They say an outside company would lack the requisite familiarity with Paterson to handle the dispatching work. Also, they say they prefer keeping city residents on the payroll to do the dispatching instead of using municipal funds to pay a company from outside of Paterson.\nThe consideration of 911 privatization comes at a time when Paterson is in the process of buying more than $1.3 million in new equipment for what would become a consolidated telecommunications operation, one that would combine those functions of the police, fire and public works departments.\nThe city's police director, Jerry Speziale, said he is looking to make changes in his department\u2019s communication division to free up officers so they can be reassigned to street duty. At present, Speziale said, more than six officers work in communications.\nIn addition to the possibility of privatization, Speziale said the city is considering using only civilians in the dispatch room. He said the proposals from the private companies would give the city some basis for evaluating its options.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about finding what\u2019s most cost-effective and efficient,\u201d the police director said.\nCouncil President William McKoy and Councilman Michael Jackson, the chairman of the public safety committee, both said they oppose hiring a private company.\n\u201cWe need people who know the city and care about the city,\u201d McKoy said.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t support anything to bring in another outside contractor to our city,\u201d Jackson said.\nCritics of the privatization proposal said the problems with the 911 system \u2014\u00a0including complaints from the public about not getting timely responses from emergency personnel when they call \u2014\u00a0likely would be addressed through the new telecommunications equipment.\nCouncilman Kenneth Morris said he wouldn\u2019t want to make any changes in the current system unless a cost-benefit analysis showed that it was in the city\u2019s best interest. Morris also said he would not want to lay off any of the people currently working as dispatchers.\nMayor Jose \"Joey\" Torres said the city decided to review the privatization at the request of the state\u00a0Department of Community Affairs, which monitors Paterson's finances as one of the conditions of the annual transition aid award from the state.\n\"At the end of the day, they can't impose it because it's something that has to be voted on by the governing body,\" he said.\nTorres said he has yet to decide\u00a0whether he supports the move. \"What we are doing now is just making an assessment.\u00a0We want to see what the numbers are,\" he said.\n"]]

Grzenda, 66, was debating giving up her longtime home after retiring but found a home-sharing match in Camacho, 26.\n(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\nThe two women are four decades apart in age \u2013 one a recent retiree worried about the high cost of living in the home where she raised her daughter, the other a 20-something working two jobs while trying to finish school in one of the most expensive rental markets in the country.\nA computer likely wouldn't spit out these two profiles as a potential roommate match.\nNevertheless, Joan\u00a0Grzenda, 66, and Alyssa Camacho, 26, are amicably sharing a three-bedroom home in Bergen County (they prefer not to name the town) in an arrangement that, for now, has solved each of their very different housing problems.\nBefore the two were introduced six months ago through an Englewood-based home-sharing program,\u00a0Grzenda\u00a0was an empty-nester not yet ready to be uprooted from the home she's owned for 23 years, although the taxes and upkeep were becoming too heavy a financial load.\nCamacho's worries were more immediate \u2013 she was technically homeless, having spent several months on the couches of family members and even spending a few nights sleeping in her car.\n\"This really helps us both,\"\u00a0Grzenda\u00a0said. \"Alyssa needed a place to live, and I needed some more time before having to figure out whether I'm going to try to stay in my house or look to move somewhere more affordable.\"\nMore millennials buying homes without parents' help\nHome-sharing is far from a new concept, but as North Jersey's population grows older, the region's high cost of living has turned the phrase into something of a buzzword among advocates looking to ease the pressures of older homeowners who either can't afford or don't want to downsize into an easier-to-manage apartment or condo.\nThere can be downsides: Because these arrangements are informal, there is no lease\u00a0nor the\u00a0legal protections\u00a0offered by one\u00a0-- a necessity in order not to violate the rules many towns have about renting rooms in single-family homes.\nBut proponents say the concept of sharing, instead of renting, can also help younger people like Camacho, who work or go to school in North Jersey but can't afford\u00a0the\u00a0region's typical\u00a0rents\u00a0-- about $1,200 a month for\u00a0a one-bedroom apartment, according to a 2016 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\"Lack of affordable housing choices is a problem for all generations,\" said Julia\u00a0Stoumbos, program officer for the Henry and Marilyn\u00a0Taub\u00a0Foundation, a Teaneck-based philanthropy that funds programs that assist both older and low-income residents.\nMany advocates for the aging say home-sharing\u00a0could be\u00a0an option for older North\u00a0Jerseyans\u00a0grappling with property taxes that are among the highest in the country.\nThose same advocates, however, recognize that such arrangements will only be successful if homeowners \u2013 and those seeking to\u00a0share a home \u2013 get assistance on how to find a good match.\nAlyssa Camacho has her own bedroom and bathroom in Joan Grzenda's home.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\nRather than being the makings of a lighthearted situation comedy,\u00a0a la \"The Golden Girls\" hit television series of the 1980s, home-sharing\u00a0arrangements can be fraught with challenges, particularly if the homeowner and home-seeker\u00a0are used to different lifestyles.\nOpening up your home to a \"friend of a friend of a friend' or answering an ad on craigslist can bring regrets, as Micki\u00a0Shilan, 82, of Teaneck can attest.\nAt present, all is well in\u00a0Shilan's\u00a0home, which she has been sharing\u00a0for about three years with the son of a good friend. The man, who is in his 60s, is so quiet and respectful that\u00a0Shilan\u00a0hardly knows he's there.\nBut\u00a0Shilan\u00a0had several bad experiences before she found her current situation, including one in which a former female roommate pulled a knife on her.\n\"There's been quite a few that were just terrible,\" said\u00a0Shilan, who never sought the\u00a0help of a home-sharing service. \"I have some stories to tell.\"\nHer\u00a0stories\u00a0are\u00a0why advocates like\u00a0Stoumbos\u00a0think there needs to be more formal guidance and support for those interested in home-sharing. But such services are hard\u00a0to find in Bergen and Passaic counties\nHomesharing\u00a0Inc., a Bridgewater-based non-profit that serves all or parts of seven New Jersey counties, expanded its territory two years ago to\u00a0include a sliver\u00a0of\u00a0Passaic County \u2013 Clifton and Little Falls. The only non-profit\u00a0providing such help in Bergen\u00a0is the Women's Rights Information Center in Englewood.\nFor years, the Englewood center,\u00a0which offers an array of assistance programs to women in distress,\u00a0has been quietly helping to place those who are homeless, or on the verge, with those\u00a0who are struggling to afford\u00a0their longtime homes.\nSusan\u00a0Bendes, a part-time center employee who runs the program,\u00a0said she typically makes\u00a0one or two matches\u00a0a month. In each, she spends\u00a0a lot of time talking to both the homeowner and the home-seeker about the nitty-gritty details of sharing space: How late is OK to use the kitchen? Is it OK to leave clothes in the dryer overnight? Whose job is it to take out the garbage? How about playing music? Watching TV? Smoking? Keeping pets?\nThe more she can get both individuals talking about their living habits,\u00a0the better the chance that a match will not only be made but last for a while. The living agreement form she asks both parties to sign is six pages long.\n\"It's hard for people to live together when they are related, much less when they don't know each other,\"\u00a0Bendes\u00a0said. \"I really try to make sure the expectations are clear, and that there aren't any surprises after someone moves in.\"\nGrzenda and Camacho say they've gotten along despite having very different tastes.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\nWhile they may be strangers in the beginning, both home-seeker and homeowner need to develop trust, as well as good rapport, since these are informal living agreements, Bendes said.\n\"This is not one person renting space in a home to another,\"\u00a0she said.\u00a0 \"These are two people who have decided to share the expenses of living together. It's important that everyone understands that distinction.\"\nIn their short time together,\u00a0Grzenda\u00a0and Camacho, who were matched by\u00a0Bendes, say they haven't really argued over anything despite having different tastes in everything from food to television programs.\n\"I'm almond milk, she's whole milk,\" said\u00a0Grzenda. \"I'm big on my vegetables while Alyssa, if she ever bought vegetables, they would rot before she got around to eating them.\"\nIn truth, because of their separate work schedules, the two are rarely home at the same time. Camacho's two jobs keep her working Monday through Saturday, often until 9 p.m. So most nights, Camacho arrives home to make dinner hours after\u00a0Grzenda, who is retired but still works three to four days a week as a substitute teacher,\u00a0 has already eaten. Culturally, they are both products of their separate generations.\u00a0Grzenda\u00a0has a couple of favorite prime-time\u00a0programs she considers \"must-see,\" while Camacho live-streams shows on the X-Box in her room.\nCamacho has her own bedroom and bathroom on the second floor,\u00a0the first time she's ever\u00a0had\u00a0that much space\u00a0to herself, and said she\u00a0gets\u00a0along well\u00a0with\u00a0Grzenda\u00a0and her dog and two cats.\n\"From the first moment I met Joan, I felt comfortable with her,\" Camacho said.\n\"I think it's because I have a daughter about her age,\"\u00a0Grzenda\u00a0added. \"I know what it's like, and I try not to get too involved in her life because it's her life.\"\nIn\u00a0making home-sharing matches,\u00a0Bendes\u00a0said it's important that\u00a0both individuals\u00a0are\u00a0looking\u00a0for the same type of relationship. Some want it to be\u00a0businesslike arrangement, where each person is respectful of the other but they don't interact much in\u00a0each other's lives, while others want company and companionship.\nThe Englewood agency has been offering free home-sharing assistance since the\u00a01970s, and in that time\u00a0matches have been made between\u00a0young\u00a0and\u00a0old, old\u00a0and\u00a0old, and even families with young children looking to help make ends meet by finding someone to live in a spare bedroom.\u00a0The program also serves men seeking home-shares.\nIt\u00a0is one of\u00a0a handful\u00a0of\u00a0non-profits in the state that offer such\u00a0assistance to potential home-sharers. The largest is\u00a0Homesharing\u00a0Inc., which started in 1984 in Somerset and Hunterdon counties\u00a0and\u00a0now has 1,700\u00a0active home-sharing matches\u00a0in\u00a0seven\u00a0counties, said executive director Lisa Blum.\nThe agency is open to the idea of expanding again to serve clients in Bergen and in the rest of Passaic County, Blum said. At the same time, the\u00a0Taub\u00a0Foundation has recently begun\u00a0exploring whether there is a need to provide seed money for more home-sharing assistance in the Bergen-Passaic area as part of a multi-town initiative to make the suburbs more \"age friendly,\"\u00a0Stoumbos\u00a0said.\nBesides the financial incentive of sharing living costs, senior homeowners\u00a0struggling to keep up with chores like snow-shoveling, yard work and grocery shopping could\u00a0\u00a0build a shared-chore arrangement into a home-share, thus curing some of their other housing headaches,\u00a0Stoumbos\u00a0said.\nBendes\u00a0thinks it is wise for senior advocates to start marketing the idea of home-sharing to seniors struggling to get by on their own.\n\"I know the idea makes a lot of seniors nervous or scared,\"\u00a0Bendes\u00a0said. \"It's hard to live together. I won't sugarcoat it. It's not easy.\"\nBut,\u00a0she added,\u00a0\"Seniors might find that it's a very helpful thing for them and a way to stay in their own home, which is what a lot of people want to do.\"\n271 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2iqBbxE\n"]]

Cory Booker\n(Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS)\nSen. Cory Booker will\u00a0speak at\u00a0a Martin Luther King Day breakfast\u00a0in Washington on Monday organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, the group that led a pre-inauguration protest march calling for ractial justice \u00a0over the weekend.\nThe appearance comes days after Booker attracted national attention by breaking with Senate tradition to appear at a hearing to argue against the confirmation of a fellow senator under consideration for a cabinet post. Booker, a Democrat from Newark, joined\u00a0with civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, to urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general.\nThough Booker spoke for a little more than five minutes on a panel of six witnesses at the end of a two-day hearing on Sessions, his appearance fueled speculation Booker is positioning himself for a possible presidential run in 2020.\nA \"We Will Not Be Moved\" march and rally at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington on Saturday mixed calls for justice and voting rights with opposition to Trump .\n\"We come not to appeal to Donald Trump, because he's made it clear what his policies are and what his nominations are,\" Sharpton said, according to The Associated Press. \"We come to say to the Democrats in the Senate and in the House and to the moderate Republicans to 'Get some backbone. Get some guts.' We didn't send you down here to be weak-kneed.\"\nSince taking the oath of office in 2013, Booker has been a leading advocate in the Senate for criminal justice reform, including a reduction in criminal sentences for drug crimes. He argues that the war on drugs helps to fuel other crime and economic despair in urban areas because of disproportionate enforcement against minorities and laws that make people with criminal records ineligible for many safety net programs, including food and housing assistance.\nThe justice reform effort was gaining bipartisan support, but Sessions, who has argued against legalizing marijuana and could be in a position to have the Justice Department crack down on states that have,\u00a0was a leading opponent. Booker also questioned Sessions' record on protecting voting rights and the rights of gay and lesbian people. At a forum in December, Booker said Sessions' nomination was a \"chilling sign\" for the chances of reform happening.\nIn addition to Sharpton and Booker, speakers at the breakfast Monday include Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia and\u00a0Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington.\n2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jNXPxP\n"]]

He also noted that New Jersey was one of only nine out of 36 states that did not approve the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery in 1865, as an example of the state's not having always been supportive of civil rights.\nLawrence Hamm of the People's Organization for Progress speaks during a rally in protest of President-elect Donald Trump in Newark on Sunday.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\nThe tone of the event\u00a0was decidedly progressive, with the crowd at times calling out traditional chants, like\u00a0\"No Justice, No Peace\" and carrying signs saying,\u00a0\"We demand jobs at a living wage.\"\nHamm was a delegate for Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention last summer, and the chairman of Sanders' state primary campaign. Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D-Middlesex, who has announced a bid for governor this fall,\u00a0also attended. Wisniewski, the only elected official to speak before the march, called for a $15 minimum wage, free college tuition\u00a0and full access to quality health care for all.\n\"We want to remember the life and legacy of Dr. King, and I wonder what he would say today,\" Wisniewski said as he touched the King statue. \"He probably would say, 'Don't build me a statue.' He didn't want things of brick and steel, of brick and mortar. His whole thing was changing people's minds, changing people's hearts.\"\nWilla Cofield, a New Jersey resident since 1969, said she always knew how old King was because she was born three months earlier. Cofield recalled a time more than a half-century ago in a small town in North Carolina when her husband, an African-American, decided to run for a local office.\nProtesters march down Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. boulevard to protest President-elect Donald Trump in Newark on Sunday.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\n\"There was a lot of whispering around, and one night my neighbor called and said to look out the window to the backyard,\" Cofield said. \"It was a burning cross.\"\nCofield said her efforts for civil rights got her fired for \"insubordination\" after 12 years as a teacher.\u00a0Upon returning from filing a lawsuit to get her job back \u2014\u00a0the process took three years \u2014\u00a0she said she had returned to find a 17-foot burning cross, this time\u00a0on her front lawn.\n\"It was terrible,\" Cofield said.\nYet Cofield seemed less fearful than many in the crowd\u00a0about the new administration.\n\"We've had other discouraging things happen before, so\u00a0I think we'll be all right,\" Cofield said. \"It will help mobilize others who need to have a voice.\"\nAbout 100 people showed up to march in protest of President-elect Donald Trump and in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Newark, NJ on Sunday, January 15, 2017.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\n"]]

The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will end the \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" in May, following a 146-year run of performances. Kenneth Feld, the chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, which owns the circus, told The Associated Press, declining attendance combined with high operating costs are among the reasons for closing.\n(Photo: Chris O'Meara, AP)\nELLENTON, Fla. \u00a0\u2014 After 146 years, the curtain is coming down on \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\" The owner of the\u00a0Ringling\u00a0Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus told The Associated Press that the show will close forever in May.\nThe iconic American spectacle was felled by a variety of factors, company executives say. Declining attendance combined with high operating costs, along with changing public tastes and prolonged battles with animal rights groups all contributed to its demise.\n\"There isn't any one thing,\" said Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment. \"This has been a very difficult decision for me and for the entire family.\"\nAnimal rights groups applaud Ringling Bros. closing\nThe company broke the news to circus employees Saturday night after shows in Orlando and Miami.\nRingling\u00a0Bros. has two touring circuses this season and will perform 30 shows between now and May. Major stops include Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and Brooklyn. The final shows will be in Providence, Rhode Island, on May 7 and in Uniondale, New York, at the Nassau County Coliseum on May 21.\nIn this Feb. 28, 1945 photo, Elizabeth Wallenda pauses on an aerial ladder during rehearsal for her return to the Wallenda troupe's high wire act with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus.\n\u00a0(Photo: Earl Shugars/AP)\nThe circus, with its exotic animals, flashy costumes and death-defying acrobats, has been a staple of entertainment in the United States since the mid-1800s. Phineas Taylor Barnum made a traveling spectacle of animals and human oddities popular, while the five\u00a0Ringling\u00a0brothers performed juggling acts and skits from their home base in Wisconsin. Eventually, they merged and the modern circus was born. The sprawling troupes traveled around America by train, wowing audiences with the sheer scale of entertainment and exotic animals.\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey acrobats ride camels during a performance Saturday, Jan. 14, 2017, in Orlando, Fla. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will end the \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" in May, following a 146-year run of performances. Kenneth Feld, the chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, which owns the circus, told The Associated Press, declining attendance combined with high operating costs are among the reasons for closing.\n\u00a0(Photo: Chris O'Meara, AP)\nBy midcentury, the circus was routine, wholesome family entertainment. But as the 20th century went on, kids became less and less enthralled. Movies, television, video games and the internet captured young minds. The circus didn't have savvy product merchandising tie-ins or Saturday morning cartoons to shore up its image.\n\"The competitor in many ways is time,\" said Feld, adding that transporting the show by rail and other circus quirks \u2014 such as providing a traveling school for performers' children\u2014 are throwbacks to another era. \"It's a different model that we can't see how it works in today's world to justify and maintain an affordable ticket price. So you've got all these things working against it.\"\nThe Feld family bought the\u00a0Ringling\u00a0circus in 1967. The show was just under 3 hours then. Today, the show is 2 hours and 7 minutes, with the longest segment \u2014 a tiger act \u2014 clocking in at 12 minutes.\n\"Try getting a 3- or 4-year-old today to sit for 12 minutes,\" he said.\nFeld and his daughter Juliette Feld, who is the company's chief operating officer, acknowledged another reality that led to the closing, and it was the one thing that initially drew millions to the show: the animals.\u00a0Ringling\u00a0has been targeted by activists who say forcing animals to perform is cruel and unnecessary.\nA Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey clown balances a hat on his nose during a pre show for fans Saturday, Jan. 14, 2017, in Orlando, Fla.\n\u00a0(Photo: Chris O'Meara, AP)\nIn May of 2016, after a long and costly legal battle, the company removed the elephants from the shows and sent the animals to live on a conservation farm in Central Florida. The animals had been the symbol of the circus since Barnum brought an Asian elephant named Jumbo to America in 1882. In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from groups including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year fight over allegations that circus employees mistreated elephants.\nBy the time the elephants were removed, public opinion had shifted somewhat. Los Angeles prohibited the use of bull-hooks by elephant trainers and handlers, as did Oakland, California. The city of Asheville, North Carolina nixed wild or exotic animals from performing in the municipally owned, 7,600-seat U.S. Cellular Center.\nIn this Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 photo, Chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, Kenneth Feld, poses for a photo, in Ellenton, Fla. Feld Entertainment, which owns The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus told The Associated Press declining attendance combined with high operating costs are among the reasons for closing. Feld said when the company removed elephants from the shows in May of 2016, ticket sales declined more dramatically than expected.\n\u00a0(Photo: Tamara Lush, AP)\nAttendance has been dropping for 10 years, said Juliette Feld, but when the elephants left, there was a \"dramatic drop\" in ticket sales. Paradoxically, while many said they didn't want big animals to perform in circuses, many others refused to attend a circus without them.\n\"We know now that one of the major reasons people came to\u00a0Ringling\u00a0Bros. was getting to see elephants,\" she said. \"We stand by that decision. We know it was the right decision. This was what audiences wanted to see and it definitely played a major role.\"\nA Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey acrobat jumps on a high wire during a performance Saturday, Jan. 14, 2017, in Orlando, Fla.\n\u00a0(Photo: Chris O'Meara, AP)\nThe Felds say their existing animals \u2014 lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas \u2014 will go to suitable homes. Juliette Feld says the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation.\nSome 500 people perform and work on both touring shows. A handful will be placed in positions with the company's other, profitable shows \u2014 it owns Monster Jam, Disney on Ice and Marvel Live, among other things \u2014 but most will be out of a job. Juliette Feld said the company will help employees with job placement and resumes. In some cases where a circus employee lives on the tour rail car (the circus travels by train), the company will also help with housing relocation.\nKenneth Feld became visibly emotional while discussing the decision with a reporter. He said over the next four months, fans will be able to say goodbye at the remaining shows.\nIn recent years,\u00a0Ringling\u00a0Bros. tried to remain relevant, hiring its first African American ringmaster, then its first female ringmaster, and also launching an interactive app. It added elements from its other, popular shows, such as motorbike daredevils and ice skaters. But it seemingly was no match for Pokemon Go and a generation of kids who desire familiar brands and YouTube celebrities.\n\"We tried all these different things to see what would work, and supported it with a lot of funding as well, and we weren't successful in finding the solution,\" said Kenneth Feld.\n779 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jKEuh6\n"]]

Record, has a lot of great things to say about his employer. Though his newsroom has had to deal with a bit of shrinkage over the years, it\u2019s still robust, with a head count of about 200. While newspaper owners in recent decades have sold out to big chains, says Gottlieb, his people have stayed firm, sticking with the industry. Stephen Borg is the fourth generation of his family to serve as publisher of the Record, the northern New Jersey paper that\u2019s often referred to as the Bergen Record. And committed, local ownership has its benefits, says Gottlieb.\nAmid the now-legendary shutdown of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, N.J. in September, Borg got something of a tip. Says Gottlieb: \u201cOur publisher gets a call from a friend of his saying it\u2019s been taking me hours to get into New York.\u201d Gottlieb passed along the information to the assignment desk; from there, it reached John Cichowski, author of the paper\u2019s \u201cRoad Warrior\u201d column, which got its founding inspiration from the Washington Post\u2019s \u201cDr. Gridlock.\u201d\nBackup at the George Washington Bridge? Whoop-dee-doo, thought Cichowski at first. \u201cA tie-up of the George Washington Bridge is not really news,\u201d Cichowski told the Erik Wemple Blog. Cichowski has been doing \u201cRoad Warrior\u201d for more than 10 years, and there are a lot of traffic jams on New Jersey highways. In this case, however, Cichowski started gathering indications that this wasn\u2019t just a one-off situation. \u201cIt happened more than once, and I started getting e-mails from people, and naturally you do an appropriate kind of phone call\u201d in such a circumstance, says Cichowski. He got this feedback from police in Fort Lee: \u201cOur town is a mess and not only is it a mess but it\u2019s been that way for a couple of days.\u201d\nStory!\nOn Friday, Sept. 13, Cichowski turned in this thoroughly reported column: \u201c Closed tollbooths a commuting disaster .\u201d Gottlieb proudly notes that reporting for the column served notice to the Port Authority\u2019s executive director that there was a traffic disaster in Fort Lee. The piece carried this quote from Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich: \u201cI\u2019ve asked the Port for an explanation, but they haven\u2019t responded. I thought we had a good relationship. Now I\u2019m beginning to wonder if there\u2019s something I did wrong. Am I being sent some sort of message?\u201d\nThat\u2019s prescient. Gov. Chris Christie this morning (and afternoon) held a press conference apologizing for the Fort Lee scandal, which reached a new level of outrage this week following the Record\u2019s reporting on smoking-gun messages among Christie staffers and loyalists in which they plot and discuss the lane closures. That news break came under the byline of Shawn Boburg, a staff writer at the Record who has been reporting on the Port Authority since 2011.\nAt the time that the bridge backups emerged as a news story, Boburg was pursuing followups to another investigative project on the Port Authority, a bistate agency with a rich history of power and cronyism. In a Sept. 8 piece, Boburg reported that the Port Authority had sold the naming rights to the World Trade Center decades ago for $10 to one of its executives : \u201cUntil his death this year, the former executive, Guy Tozzoli, earned millions primarily by licensing the name through the group, the World Trade Centers Association. And the Port Authority is among the hundreds of licensees around the world paying thousands of dollars each year for the privilege of using the words \u2018World Trade Center.'\u201d\nOnce he finished off the WTC-naming-rights story, Boburg hopped on the toll-lanes investigation. About a dozen public-records requests pushed the story forward, says Boburg, who describes an interesting dynamic in prying documents from the Port Authority. Since it\u2019s a bistate entity filled with political appointees of various loyalties, it\u2019s tough to get records requests through the thicket. That same dynamic, however, ensures that some of the records being sought formally get leaked informally. \u201cThere were documents leaked to us several times that would be responsive [to public document requests] if they had actually supplied the documents,\u201d says Boburg, noting that the formal response from the Port Authority has been to seek more time to fulfill the requests.\nAfter the Record blew open the story yesterday morning, news outlets everywhere scrambled to match the story \u2014 and to acquire the documents that the Record had acquired. An attribution in the New York Times reads like this : \u201cThe documents were obtained by The New York Times and other news outlets Wednesday.\u201d A similar attribution appears in The Post . Boburg: \u201cI don\u2019t know this but I believe they also obtained them. . . . All I know is that we had them first.\u201d\nThe work of Chichowski and Boburg, says publisher Borg, is part of a \u201cserious\u201d news operation that is the jewel of a diversified media corporation. The North Jersey Media Group consists of the Record, 46 weekly community newspapers with a combined circulation of 500,000, printing operations with customers such as USA Today and Investor\u2019s Business Daily,\u00a0 (201) Magazine and others. The newspaper\u2019s staffing has weathered the decade-long industry decline by losing just 10 percent of its newsroom staff from its peak, says Borg, and there are \u201cno future staff reductions planned.\u201d\nopinions\n"]]

In 1881 it officially became the\u00a0circus\u00a0that generations grew up watching and saw many evolutions over the years, most recently with its decision to retire its elephant acts.\n___\n\u2014 1841 \u2014 Phineas Taylor Barnum buys Scudder's American Museum in New York City and renames it Barnum's American Museum, which was something of a zoo, museum, lecture hall and freak show. It was filled with artifacts and items from around the world. The museum later burned down. Barnum also took his show on the road as \"P.T. Barnum's Grand Traveling American Museum.\"\n\u2014 1881 \u2014 Barnum partners with James A. Bailey and James L. Hutchinson for \"P.T. Barnum's Greatest Show On Earth, And The Great London\u00a0Circus, Sanger's Royal British Menagerie and The Grand International Allied Shows United,\" later shortened to the \"Barnum & London\u00a0Circus.\"\n\u2014 1882 \u2014 The Ringling Brothers \u2014 Alf, Al, Charles, John and Otto \u2014 performed their first vaudeville-style show in Mazomanie, Wisconsin.\n\u2014 1884 \u2014 The Ringling Brothers\u00a0Circus\u00a0begins as a traveling performance.\n\u2014 1887 \u2014 The official Ringling touring show became the \"Ringling Bros. United Monster Shows, Great Double\u00a0Circus, Royal European Menagerie, Museum, Caravan, and Congress of Trained Animals.\"\n\u2014 1895 \u2014 The Ringlings decided to branch out to New England, which was already the territory of P.T. Barnum. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, the two circuses \"agreed to divide the U.S. rather than compete head-to-head.

We certainly would be. Trump, a car crash that learned how to walk and wear suits, is addicted to attention, and the media is addicted to giving him attention. None of that will change if he loses to Hillary Clinton . Trump himself said this week that he has \u201c no interest in Trump TV ,\u201d but Trump says a lot of things, so it\u2019s worth at least speculating about what the network would look like.\nThe enterprise would definitely have potential, at least for the Trump base and America\u2019s most committed hate-watchers. As a streaming and cable TV star, Trump would be second to none. He\u2019d be capable of gobbling the Kardashians\u2019 lunch, dinner and the next day\u2019s elevenses . How could he not? As the poet Patricia Lockwood has said, Trump is \u201c human meth \u201d \u2015 a singularly galvanizing and destructive blend of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, Beavis and Butt-Head, Michael Moore, Alex Jones, George Wallace, Benito Mussolini and Vince the ShamWow Guy.\nAnd if you think about it, he\u2019s made it this far based on little more than a skill set gleaned from years in the reality-teevee trenches and a lifelong fascination with television. So it really could work.\nBut even Donald Trump can\u2019t be on the air all the time \u2015 not even on his own network. He\u2019d need a programming schedule of shows, just like on any other channel. And so on this week\u2019s First To Last, we\u2019ve put one together. The only thing we really can\u2019t account for is whether Vladimir Putin would be a contributor or a competitor. (Both, probably.)\nRANK\nTV SHOW\nPhotos: Getty, Associated Press\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\nMore:\n"]]

That\u2019s right! There are Senate races galore. Even House races. Probably some ballot initiatives, too. It\u2019s not all Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton in the Terrordome of American politics.\nAnd to be honest, we\u2019re missing out whenever our attention strays too far from the down ticket battles. The competition looks to be tight \u2015 many of our august political augurs are looking at a potentially split Senate, with our mostly forgotten vice presidential candidates potentially looming as long-term tie-breakers and deal makers (as president of the Senate, the vice president can be called on to cast votes in a deadlock).\nNot to mention the fact that in the U.S.\u00a0Senate, 51 votes is often not enough. Trump and Clinton may have designs on and desires for the Supreme Court \u2015 but neither of them is good enough to necessarily avoid dying at the hands of the Senate filibuster.\nRight now, Democrats are telling their contributors and voters that they had better step up now because come 2018, they have a raft of people up for re-election, and are going to be very exposed. And let\u2019s remember our history: Should Hillary win, she\u2019ll face a problem that continually bedevils the party holding the White House \u2015 in their first midterm election, their legislators tend to get creamed.\nSo the stakes are high. But there\u2019s something else that you can only find when you start glancing at the down ticket races \u2015 blessed normalcy. The arguments over issues, the wrangling of party machers, even all the Beltway-centric cocktail party chatter as to whether the relatively quiet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) will continue to preside over the upper house, or if Congress\u2019 most loquacious microphone fiend, Chuck Schumer, takes over \u2015 it all feels like a serene reminder of the time before rejected horseman of the apocalypse Trump turned American politics into a deranged arrangement.\nWe never thought that we\u2019d find a soothing tonic in a battle between Evan Bayh and Todd Young over an Indiana Senate seat, but here we are. And on this week\u2019s first to last, we revisit the barnburner Senate match-ups that could end up shaping our near future.\nFLORIDA: MARCO RUBIO (R, incumbent) vs. PATRICK MURPHY (D)\nThis could be the surprise of election night, with most polls\u00a0saying it\u2019s at a dead heat . Rubio has still refused to unendorse Trump ( why, we don\u2019t know ), and Murphy is holding strong, despite the fact that national Democrats have pulled their resources out of the race . Murphy is a somewhat damaged candidate \u2015 early on in the race the Rubio camp made hay over several significant examples of resume inflation . But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s decision to leave Murphy to his own devices has some people puzzled .\nNEW HAMPSHIRE: KELLY AYOTTE (R, incumbent) vs. MAGGIE HASSAN (D)\nThings are looking grim for Ayotte in the latest WaPo poll , which has her down 8 points. Ayotte\u2019s whole Trump is-or-isn\u2019t a role model thing right before the leaked tape probably didn\u2019t help. The Boston Globe has pointed out\u00a0that New Hampshire tends to vote for\u00a0 Democratic senators during presidential election years , a trend to which the state seems to be reverting.\nPENNSYLVANIA: PAT TOOMEY (R, incumbent) vs. KATIE McGINTY (D)\nTrumpians thought they had a chance in Pa., what with all that Deer Hunter country. He\u2019s probably going to lose, but moderate Republicans who feel guilty voting for Clinton could split their tickets and save Toomey.\nINDIANA: EVAN BAYH (D) vs. TODD YOUNG\nMiddle-of-the-road Evan Bayh wanted it both ways: he works as a lobbyist in D.C. and then returns home to run as an outsider. But the Chamber of Commerce , with which he once worked, has made him its number-one target. To the dismay of liberals, Bayh kept $10 million from his PAC in 2008 rather than give it to the Democratic Party. He\u2019s now spent it all, but could still lose to sharp young conservative Rep. Young.\nILLINOIS: MARK KIRK (R, incumbent) vs. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D)\nDuckworth is killing the fundraising game, outraising Kirk 3-to-1 over the summer . Will all those ad buys pay off? She leads in the polls but savvy Illinois Democrats worry that Kirk has a way of surviving by shuckin\u2019 and jivin.\u2019 He plays \u201cmoderate\u201d with the best of them.\nMISSOURI: ROY BLUNT (R, incumbent) vs. JASON KANDER (D)\nIn the last two weeks according to Nate Silver, the chances that upstart Kander ends up taking this election from Sen. Blunt has risen over 22 points. 22 POINTS . Blunt is suffering from both edges of the Trump effect \u2015 an outsider new to politics is running against him (he\u2019s just a democrat) and Trump is imploding. Plus, one of the most genius ads of the election cycle hasn\u2019t hurt Kander\u2019s rise either. And Sen. Al Franken, a leader in the Dems take-back-the-Senate drive, has been touting presciently Kander for a year.\nWISCONSIN: RON JOHNSON (R, incumbent) vs. RUSS FEINGOLD (D)\nAnother former senator trying a comeback, Feingold is a better bet than Bayh. It\u2019s another state the Trump forces targeted, but Feingold has more than enough anti-establishment juice to survive, or even thrive, in this era. He could also be a next-generation Bernie in 2020 if he wins.\nNEVADA: JOE HECK (R) vs. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D)\nThis is a race to replace the irreplaceable, irrepressible, inimitable and \u2015 to his many detractors \u2015 annoying Harry Reid. With its right wing casino crowd and mass of Hispanic voters, Nevada is on the fault line of politics. If Hispanic turnout gives Hillary Clinton a victory, it could sweep in Cortez Masto, too.\nNORTH CAROLINA: RICHARD BURR (R, incumbent) vs. DEBORAH ROSS (D)\nIn North Carolina, incumbent Sen. Richard Burr is holding off his Democratic challenger \u2015 but perhaps only just. In a familiar story, Burr\u2019s prospects are being weighed down by his party\u2019s presidential standardbearer. As a recent NPR report details , whether or not you disavow or embrace Trump has a distinctive damned-if-you-do-or-don\u2019t flavor. Trump\u2019s flame-out has helped Ross add to her campaign coffers, but the word is that Burr has enough cash on hand to last out the cycle.\nMore:\n"]]

Most of the shows will be held in the South or the East Coast. Major stops include Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and Brooklyn. Tickets can still be purchased online and at venues.\n___\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE EMPLOYEES?\nThe Feld family has owned the circus for 49 years, and employs some 500 people for the show. Those employees were told about the closure on Saturday night, after shows in Orlando and Miami. A handful will be placed in positions with the company's other shows \u2014 it owns Monster Jam, Disney on Ice and Marvel Live, among other things \u2014 but most will be out of a job. Chief Operating Officer Juliette Feld said the company will help employees with job placement and resumes. In some cases where a circus employee lives on the tour rail car (the circus travels by train), the company will also help with housing relocation.\n___\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE ANIMALS?\nIn May of 2016,\u00a0Ringling\u00a0retired all of its elephants to a property in central Florida. Forty elephants live at the Center for Elephant Conservation in Polk County. But the circus still has other animals, such as lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas.\nJuliette Feld says homes will be found for the animals, but the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation.\n___\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE COSTUMES AND PROPS?\nThe Feld family hasn't decided what it will do with the enormous warehouse filled with circus costumes and props. Kenneth Feld says the company will continue to work with the Circus Museum at The\u00a0Ringling\u00a0in Sarasota. That museum holds memorabilia dating to the 1800s, when John\u00a0Ringling\u00a0and his family founded\u00a0Ringling\u00a0Bros and Barnum and Bailey Circus.\nIn this March 27, 1955 file photo, a policeman calmly directs a parade of elephants across the busy intersection of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in New York.

There are actually hundreds of races happening, including many for this thing called \u201cThe House Of Representatives.\u201d You remember those folks, right? Well, they\u2019re all up for re-election as well.\nThere are a lot of things that we can\u2019t say about the House races. One thing we can\u2019t say is that there are big changes afoot \u2015 despite the fact that Congress\u2019 approval rating eternally hovers between \u201cgallbladder infection\u201d and \u201cplague of frogs,\u201d incumbent members enjoy a staggeringly high rate of re-election (because it\u2019s always some other person\u2019s congressional representative cocking things up). We can\u2019t use the term \u201cbarnburner\u201d to describe many of these races because we\u2019ve only got scant polling data to examine.\nStill, these races matter, and many of them are fascinating in their own right. There are fresh faces, enduring rivalries and big money. In some cases, there are interesting changes in the political landscape. In others, there are old figures reaching for one last shot in politics. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the House somehow flips control from the GOP to the Democrats , right? Actually, probably not.\nLook at it this way: These races are going to happen one way or another.

They each have a daughter with special needs, and both moms wanted \u201ca true ballet experience for the girls, one that was also in a forgiving environment,\u201d Sheehy says.\nMatejka-Grossman, a former professional ballerina, joined with Sheehy and started a ballet class in her living room. The program was much needed so it kept expanding. The end result is Sharing the Arts (sharingthearts.com).\nAccording to the website, its mission \u201cis to enhance the lives of individuals with special needs through the performing arts. Classes are led by teachers with support staff to provide redirection and assistance. Pre-teen through college-age volunteers serve as assistants, demonstrators, mentors, as well as friends in the class.\u201dThe programs offered include preballet/ jazz, hip-hop, vocal, acting and musical theater. Saturday classes are run through the Ridgewood Community School, and volunteers come from all over, including Ramapo High School, Indian Hills High School, Immaculate Heart Academy, Ridgewood High School and Glen Rock High School.\nMatejka-Grossman emphasizes the importance of having peer role models. One excellent example of this is the Sharing the Arts clubs that have arisen at area high schools, including Ridgewood, Glen Rock and Glen Ridge.\nAt Ridgewood High School, the special needs participants come from all over, including New York City and the Delaware Water Gap, while the volunteers are Ridgewood High School students.\n\u201cThe musical productions allow the kids to have a typical experience and find common ground with volunteers. Everyone can come together,\u201d Matejka- Grossman says. \u201cIt has definitely changed the lives of the kids. It is also great for volunteers. Some of them have gone on to medical school or to become teachers in special education.\u201d\nSheehy emphasizes that \u201cit is the real collaboration between students, volunteers and staff at the high school that make it all work. It is very grassroots. A lot of people help along the way, and it is a labor of love.\u201d\nJennifer Landa, a faculty adviser for the Sharing the Arts club at Ridgewood High School, is very enthusiastic about the program, which is exceptionally popular among the students. The club \u2013 usually consisting of 30 volunteers or more \u2013 started approximately five years ago. The students in that program were already learning to work with younger kids, and this was a natural extension of that.\n\u201cThe volunteers pick a show, edit a junior version, assign roles, choreograph, stage scenes, and make sure everyone has a chance to shine,\u201d Landa says. \u201cThey mount a full production with costumes, lights, microphones, and they do an amazing job.

Mike Pence (R) as his running mate, the consensus that quickly congealed among the political commentariat was that Trump had finally done something boring and conventional. Hashtag sad!\nWell. First of all,\u00a0political reporters should probably not always be asking politicians to provide them with entertainment \u2015 that whole \u201cMay you live in interesting times\u201d thing is supposed to be a curse, remember?\nBut more importantly, a Trump-Pence pairing could actually be quite exciting, because it turns out that the two men, in terms of policy, have some pretty big disagreements. We\u2019re talking about\u00a0core\u00a0differences, with the governor\u2019s record diverging from what Trump has verbalized in the past year in numerous, non-trivial ways.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not to say there was an easier choice Trump could have made. If he was looking for a sturdy, establishment type to serve as a helpmate, it was inevitable that he\u2019d end up paired with someone who didn\u2019t share a lot of his views. But Pence is still an odd pick, all things considered. Chris Christie\u2019s rambunctious sycophancy might have smoothed over any of the differences he and Trump had during the primaries. And while Newt Gingrich\u2019s positions sometimes clashed with Trump\u2019s, the former speaker\u2019s penchant for silver-tongued glibness might have helped him artfully flip-flop around those deviations.\nIt makes you wonder \u2015 was Trump even aware of Pence\u2019s policy preferences as he staged his low-key \u201cApprentice\u201d act to determine his campaign partner?

Protesters were demanding a $15-per-hour minimum wage.\n(Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com)\nStory Highlights\nNew Jersey's minimum wage is $8.44\nA group of activists stood in snow and freezing temperatures at the entrance to New Jersey\u2019s largest mall Saturday afternoon to draw attention to the hottest issue facing the retail industry, low-income workers\u00a0and state lawmakers \u2013 the fight for a\u00a0$15 minimum wage.\nThree dozen protesters from a coalition of groups held banners and signs, sang songs, chanted slogans, listened to speeches, waved to passing cars, and even engaged in political discourse with motorists on a street corner at the southwest entrance to Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you working? Go to work,\u201d yelled a woman who rolled down her window while the car she was a passenger in was parked at the light at the intersection of Passaic Street and the Garden State Parkway exit ramp.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday,\u201d responded one protester. \u201cWe do work,\u201d yelled another. \u201cAnd we want a living wage.\u201d\nPump your own gas? Many willing if it means $15 minimum wage\nSigns of support\nMost of the drivers heading to the mall on Saturday, however, demonstrated support for the rally,\u00a0honking to show solidarity and giving protesters the thumbs-up sign.\nOrganizers said they staged the protest to keep pressure on the state\u2019s lawmakers to either get\u00a0a $15 minimum wage question on the ballot\u00a0or to pass legislation that could be signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s successor.\nIn August, Christie vetoed legislation that gradually would have raised New Jersey's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2021. That bill, if signed by the governor, would have made New Jersey the third state in the country, after California and New York, to raise the hourly wage to $15. The current minimum wage in New Jersey is $8.44 an hour.\nThe state's Democratic lawmakers have made raising the minimum wage a key part of their legislative agenda for the past four years but have been met by strong opposition from\u00a0Christie. Democrats now are expected to wait until after the gubernatorial election in November to pass minimum wage legislation\u00a0in the hopes that a Democrat will be elected to succeed\u00a0Christie.\nActivists outside the state's largest mall, Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, demanding an increase in the minimum wage.\n\u00a0(Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com)\nRetail opposition\nRetail organizations are strongly opposed to the $15-an-hour campaign, saying it raises wages too much, too quickly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re more than willing to have a discussion about increasing the minimum wage,\u201d said John Holub, president of the New Jersey Retail Merchants Association, but \"it has to be a reasonable amount, phased in over a period of time.\"\nRetailers\u00a0operate on \"incredibly small margins,\" Holub said, and can't absorb dramatic cost increases, especially at a time when they are struggling with weak spending and online competition. \"We're still continuing to scratch and claw our way out of the recession,\" he said\nThe protest was\u00a0organized by the group 15NowNJ\u00a0and co-sponsored by the Socialist Alternative, Green Party of New Jersey, New Jersey Democratic Socialists of America, Black Lives Matter Paterson and Red Party of New Jersey organizations.\nDebra Lamego, 36, a Kearny resident who works as a sales associate at the mall, was among the protesters Saturday. Lamego, who makes $9.99 an hour, did not want to say at which store she works because it could jeopardize her employment. She said most retail workers support the $15 wage campaign but \u201care afraid to speak up because they fear for their jobs.\u201d\n\u201cI feel that we have to continuously remind people that this issue isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIf we keep at it, and keep pressuring our local officials, we can make the changes we need.\u201d\nMore protests planned\nBrian Powers of 15NowNJ said the mall location was chosen for the protest, because, like past protest sites, it is a place \"where a lot of people are working for under minimum wage.\" He said the group plans to hold \u00a0more protests throughout the year and will have an organizing meeting next month in New Brunswick.\nPowers said two of the leading Democratic contenders for governor, Phil Murphy and John Wisniewski, have committed to signing minimum wage legislation if elected.\n\u201cIf we can push the Legislature to pass the bill once we have a new governor, we can anticipate the new governor signing it,\"\u00a0Powers said.\nProtest leaders said they are confident that there is widespread support for a $15 minimum wage in New Jersey. Ed Fanning, chairman of the Bergen County Green Party, said New Jerseyans are very willing to sign petitions for minimum wage increases compared to other issues. \"Most people you ask \u2013 complete strangers on the streets \u2013 are very willing to sign to support it,\" he said.\n768 CONNECT TWEET 5 LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2ixoSQi\n"]]

A. Pereira, Correspondent 1:21 p.m. ET Jan. 14, 2017\nJonathan Alter, Stephen Engelberg and Thomas Johnson took part in a discussion on Donald Trump at the Montclair Public Library.\n(Photo: Photo/Cindy C. A. Pereira)\nDonald Trump\u2019s upcoming first 100 days as president was discussed at the Montclair Public Library as part of their Open Book/Open Mind Series on Jan.\u00a08.\nJonathan Alter, NBC/MSNBC News correspondent and bestselling biographer of Obama and FDR, and Stephen Engelberg, editor-in-chief of ProPublica were in conversation with Thomas Johnson, Executive Editor of Bloomberg Politics.\nThe incoming\u00a0president has expressed opinions about the fate of Obamacare, climate change, wealth inequity and much more. The panel dissected a handful of these topics to an audience that filled the room to capacity.\nNotably, more than once, President Nixon was referenced in making comparisons to the current state of affairs. The Nixon parallel was also an example of the country\u2019s ability to survive and overcome.\nLocals to be present or protest Trump inauguration\nOne of the first topics was Vladimir Putin. Engelberg, whose first beat was the CIA, expressed his feeling toward Trump\u2019s handling and opinion of the CIA, as relates to Russia\u2019s tampering with the recent US election. He said he was feeling dumbfounded.\n\u201cWe have a president that before being elected is telling the intelligence the right answer. From a policy level it\u2019s incomprehensible,\u201d said Engelberg. \"What really upset me was the partisan reaction when we learned this happened\u2026People are willing to put their party ahead of their country.\u201d\nAlter implied that the question of the media\u2019s role both in disseminating non-newsworthy stories around the topic of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails while the FBI had information on this newsworthy event may have been more decisive in the election.\nOn the question of how ordinary citizens can engage long before the next election, Alter said, \u201cIf you are in New Jersey\u00a0and politically inclined you can join Blue Wave NJ, you can give non-profits like ProPublica money, but everybody needs to enlist to resist\u2026 these are not ordinary times.\u201d\nAlter said objectivity and balance are not number one in journalism. He stated that at the time the press was given protection by the constitution, the constitution was protecting an institution that went for truth and accuracy first and then fairness and balance. He talked about the role of television during the campaign saying, \u201cRatings were so connected to popularity. We are not supposed to be popular.\u201d\nJohnson asked specifically about what actions we should expect in the first 100 days. Engelberg responded by mentioning the complexities of Obamacare. He said, \u201cThe notion this thing can be quickly rewritten on the back of an envelope in the caucus room is absolutely frightening.\u201d\nAfter breaking down the elements of Obamacare that could not be dissolved with any immediacy he did say that some action would need to happen \u201cAfter they made so much of a fuss about repealing Obamacare.\u201d\n\u201cLegislatively it only takes 50 votes to repeal Obamacare but it takes 60 to replace it,\u201d said Alter.\nHe said Republicans would be wary about having the requisite votes to repeal it but insufficient votes to replace it. On that note he added, eliciting laughter, \u201cAs a practical matter they will replace Obamacare with\u2026Obamacare. Very little will change within the next four years.\u201d\nIn searching for more potential changes in the first 100 days, Alter said, \u201cThey will try to reopen negotiations on NAFTA.\u201d He also noted that the Secretary of State is vulnerable as he represents the United States. Alter said that even one Tweet from Trump undermining the Secretary of State would be disastrous.\nEngleberg, when the topic of Trump being instrumental in addressing infrastructure issues came up, commiserated about the state of Penn Station or Laguardia Airport for example. \u201cIt\u2019s scandalous, it\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s beneath us, but this has nothing to do with his [Trump\u2019s] notion of tax credits.\u201d He cautioned, \u201cPrivate companies are not going to invest in rebuilding a sewer system.\u201d Engleberg said they would be interested in new infrastructure.\nAlter said Trump was not that ideological and it was entirely possible he would cut a deal with Sen. Chuck Schumer. \u201cThey will try to cut corporate income tax,\u201d he opined.\nEngelberg added, \u201cI do think a reasonably fair tax bill that allows repatriation of billions of dollars offshore\u2026 potentially Trump could pull that off.\u201d\nAlter noted that it had been tried before and ultimately failed saying, \u201cUnless you can figure out a way to keep them in the United States\u2026\u201d\nThe question of whether Democrats would try to block Republicans as the Republicans have done throughout the Obama Administration came up. Alter said, \u201cI think he [Schumer] wants to get things done. He can negotiate with Trump\u2026\u201d\nWithin that context the subject of the Supreme Court nominations up. Previously one senator could put a hold on a nomination of lower courts but the rules have changed. Supreme Court nominations now require a super majority. Alter expressed concern over Justice Ginsberg\u2019s health and longevity and said, \u201cI just hope she stays healthy because two justices would really change things.\u201d\nIn attempting to answer the question of how Trump got elected to begin with, the popular vote being 2.9 million votes in favor of Clinton was mentioned seemingly as an implied argument that it was not a clear win.\nHowever, Alter endeavored to relate a few more concrete reasons why people may have gravitated toward Trump. He listed Trump\u2019s assertion that he loves the poorly educated and suggested Trump may be a poor person\u2019s idea of what a rich person is. Ultimately after telling a personal anecdote about his own mother in politics, Alter added \u201c People will not\u00a0vote for a woman simply because she is a woman.\u201d\nThe issue of fake news was brought up in the context of reaching what Alter called the convincible middle by disseminating relevant and accurate news. He said, \u201cWe are segregating as a country about where we are getting our information.\u201d\nAs for what the average citizen can do in the current political environment, the general audience was encouraged to go out and organize based on their individual interests. \u201cMany organizations are doing plenty of good work,\u201d said Alter, and then he specified Planned Parenthood and environmental groups as some examples.\nAlter also said mobilizing resentment can start in fourth grade. His example was kids labeling Trump\u2019s Tweets as bullying.\nAs for the role of journalists, they were cautioned to stay vigilant and tell stories in a way that holds people accountable.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jJuK6A\n"]]

He plans to leave from New Jersey by train and arrive there the day before.\nHe said that he has a ticket to stand in an area on the Capitol Grounds.\nByrne said he has enjoyed the experience of being there in-person for the inaugurations, recalling\u00a0Ronald Reagan's\u00a0inauguration in 1981 as his favorite.\n\"That was the one where it was announced that the prisoners were released and there was this a huge cheer,\" Byrne said. He was referring to 52 Americans who had been held hostage in Iran for 444 days, and were released while Reagan was giving his inaugural address.\nAlso planning to attend the inauguration is U.S. Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, who represents New Jersey\u2019s 11th Congressional District, which covers 54 municipalities in Essex, Morris, Passaic and Sussex Counties, including the northern part of Montclair.\nFrelinghuysen said in a statement to The Times:\u00a0\u201cI have attended every Presidential inauguration \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2013 since 1995. \u00a0To be an eyewitness to the orderly transfer of authority under our Constitution is quite an honor.\u201d\nOne person who will not be able to witness the inauguration is Steve Rogers, who serves on the Nutley Board of Commissioners, and was an adviser to the Trump presidential campaign. Rogers\u00a0was also the first New Jersey elected official to publicly endorse Donald Trump.\nRogers told The Times that he will be the keynote speaker at an inauguration gala in Mahwah being held on the same day as the inauguration. He said this is one of many that will held in states across the country to accommodate people who are not able to attend.\n\"I opted to stay up here and speak on the 20th,\" Rogers said. \"I was invited, and I opted not to go because there was many, many grassroots citizens who were not able to go.\n\"So I thought it was kind of a nice gesture to them, to say, 'Hey, you know you were with us during the campaign, and now we're going to be with you for the inauguration.\"\nSeething at the next president\nTeka Lark-Lo said she knew people who took issue with how the protest was organized and understood those concerns. However, she hoped people will attend and see the large picture.\n\"We can\u2019t all agree on the same things, but we need to come together to rally people, and to combat this incoming administration,\" Lark-Lo said.\nLark-Lo said that she feels like she is a \"patriot\" in participating in the protest.\n\"Being a patriot means standing up for yourself,\" Lark-Lo said.\nShe said some of the issues that she looks forward to hearing about at the protest include universal childcare.\nMontclair resident Colleen Daly Martinez will also be going to the protest with her husband, who works at Montclair State University, and her daughter, who is a student at Hillside School.\n\"I think the day after the election, people started talking about this march,\" Martinez said. \"I was immediately very interested, and I talked my husband about bringing our kid. We are excited about going.\"\nMartinez said she felt it was important to attend to make their voices known about issues that they are passionate about such as preserving women's reproductive health, but also it being a learning experience for her daughter.\n\"I want her to have a good experience to see how people organize and stand up,\" Martinez said.\nBlueWaveNJ, the Montclair-based progressive policy group, has been organizing members to attend the Washington, D.C., protest, and\u00a0related protests happening the same day in Trenton and in New York City, according to Cary Chevat, one of the founders of BlueWaveNJ.\nChevat said at least 800 people have already been signed up by BlueWave to board buses from Montclair to go to the various protests, with the bulk of them going to Washington, D.C.\nEmail: kaulessar@northjersey.com\n4 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jIRvHS\n"]]

Grewal struck a conciliatory tone on Friday in a conversation with The Record, apologizing for closing his inauguration ceremon y to the public and media and talking about his plans for the county Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\nGrewal, an Indian-American Sikh who is the first South Asian to hold the county prosecutor position, acknowledged the event should have been open to reporters, and said his office handled it \u201cnot as well as we should have.\u201d\nReporters who showed up at Bergen Community College to cover the event Thursday afternoon should have been let in, he said.\nInstead, a Bergen County sheriff\u2019s officer posted at the campus entrance told a reporter and photographer the event was closed to the press. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office had deemed\u00a0it private, the officer said, but gave no reason why. Then the officer demanded the reporter and photographer leave the property.\n\u201cWe fumbled it,\u201d Grewal said. \u201cHad it been brought to my attention right away, we would have tried to handle it differently.\u201d\nIn an interview Friday after an appearance at Glen Rock High School, where he spoke to students about the dangers of opioid addiction , Grewal said his office anticipated a closed ceremony since it began planning it last month. Similar events the prosecutor has attended as a guest were similarly private, he said.\nGurbir S. Grewal sworn in as Bergen County prosecutor\nMany state officials, including state\u00a0senators,\u00a0General\u00a0Assembly members, municipal police chiefs\u00a0and county prosecutors from across the state attended the ceremony in the college\u2019s 300-seat Ciccone Theatre.\nGrewal, a Democrat, served as acting prosecutor for nearly a year after Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie appointed him in\u00a0January 2016. But a unanimous confirmation vote in the state Senate in November allowed him to shed the \u201cacting\u201d title. He will serve a five-year term as the agency\u2019s head.\nChristie was supposed to attend, but he canceled about 9 a.m. Thursday. Grewal said his office was told the governor was ill.\nThe decision to make the ceremony private was made\u00a0well before\u00a0the governor committed to coming, Grewal said.\nPlans\u00a0\nGrewal, a Glen Rock resident, provided a copy of his inauguration speech to The Record on Friday morning. He sat down with a reporter that afternoon to speak about his plans for the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which employs about 265 people, including 105 detectives and 60 prosecutors.\nAs head of that agency, Grewal will exercise significant power \u2013 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office regularly conducts complex criminal investigations, oversees municipal police departments\u00a0and puts together regional task forces.\nGrewal said he wants to further increase collaboration with municipal police forces, starting with the expansion of a program that \u201cloans\u201d municipal officers to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office for six- to 12-month terms.\nThis gives those officers, of which there will be about a dozen this year, a greater breadth of experience, he said, and it develops trust between the county office and local police forces.\n\u201cIt helps the municipalities develop points of contact with us, and it helps municipalities better train their detectives,\u201d he said.\nGrewal, a father of three, also wants to tackle the county\u2019s burgeoning opioid abuse problems, which he called \u201ca public health issue.\u201d The prosecutor said he would\u00a0address this through collaborative programs like Operation Helping Hand, which sought to get drug offenders arrested last\u00a0summer\u00a0into a county detox program.\nHe also will continue giving presentations to local students on opioid addiction \u2014 the office did 50 presentations last year that reached 10,000 students, he said. He said he hopes to work with schools to increase the number\u00a0of parents who attend the presentations.\nGrewal talked about being the first Sikh in the prosecutor position,\u00a0and said\u00a0he felt\u00a0his successes and his failures would reflect on his community.\nHe said he\u00a0hoped\u00a0to\u00a0break\u00a0some of the stereotypes of those who follow his religion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a burden, but it\u2019s something I embrace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, but I\u2019m enjoying it. And it\u2019s good for law enforcement.\u201d\n25 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2iut97b\n"]]

Deer,\u00a0tree frogs\u00a0and other types of birds such as warblers are spotted here and will be threatened by\u00a0construction, Gore said.\n\u201cThese are my concerns, but it\u2019s mostly for human beings,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople love living here.

At that point, it\u2019ll be time for another round of hard choices, because in order to move forward, she\u2019ll have to knit the fractious Democratic coalition back together . And she\u2019ll have to close the deal with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) before the July convention in Philadelphia. What to do, what to do? Besides maybe electing Debbie Wasserman-Schultz's primary opponent , Tim Canova. (Which wouldn't be a bad idea , to be honest .)\nIt starts by acknowledging that Sanders has helpfully revealed a lot about the concerns of the younger revelers in the Democratic ranks. As a candidate who's often depicted as being too rooted in the 1990s, Clinton has a lot to gain from the insights of this new generation of voters whom Sanders has encouraged to become involved in politics. It\u2019s a big prize, but it won\u2019t -- and shouldn\u2019t -- be freely given. So it\u2019s time for some concessions.\nHere at First To Last, we\u2019ve written out a menu of friendly gestures, ranging from fun and good cheer to serious offers that could define Clinton\u2019s campaign and point the way toward a shared future between both candidates\u2019 camps.

He said the spraying\u00a0will\u00a0keep up to 2 inches of snow from sticking to the asphalt.\nThe borough\u00a0makes it's own\u00a0brine salt-water solution, which it now sells to the county and other municipalities.\nThe program, which started over a year ago, is what borough officials consider a success. Mayor Richard\u00a0Goldberg\u00a0said the township\u00a0recently renewed contracts\u00a0to sell brine for 15 cents a gallon to\u00a0Ridgewood and Passaic County. Hawthorne also\u00a0is under contract to brine all\u00a0county roads in Hawthorne for roughly $600 per snow event.\nSelling the brine to other municipalities is a way to recoup the $73,000 cost of the borough\u2019s initial investment in the computerized mobile brine-making unit, Goldberg said.\nThe prospects of serving other towns could be expanded even further with the addition of a storage tank\u00a0under consideration by the\u00a0Borough Council, Goldberg said.\nBecause 15 cents a gallon is minimal, he said, selling brine to other towns is more of a shared service than a profit-making venture.\nThe financial picture is made rosier by the savings of about 30 percent that comes from using less salt on the roads, Scully said. In recent years, towns have run up against a shortage of road salt, so brine helps with this.\nSince brine is applied before a storm, Goldberg added, \u201cwe can do it during the workday without involving overtime,\u201d for another potential savings.\n\u201cWe\u2019re covering our costs plus a little more. We don\u2019t make enough that it impacts the budget,\u201d Borough Administrator Eric\u00a0Maurer said.\nIn 2016, Maurer said, the borough sold 13,200 gallons\u00a0to Ridgewood\u00a0for $792 and\u00a09,875 gallons to the\u00a0county\u00a0for $592.\nThe back of a Hawthorne Department of Public Works truck with a 9,000-gallon tank used to distribute the brine solution on the roads in preparation for ice and snow.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\nYet saving money is not the true reason for the starting the brine program, borough officials said.\n\u201cThe big impetus is to improve the quality of our roads and the safety,\u201d Maurer said, noting that clearing the way for school buses was a big issue.\nAs a result of the brine, there are no more icy roads, Maurer said.\u00a0\u201cResidents, particularly on the hills, will recognize the difference.\"\nFor\u00a0brine\u00a0to have the best results, Scully said, his crews must spray the roads within three days of a snow event\u00a0\u2013\u00a0no sooner. Because any rainfall will defeat their effort,\u00a0timing\u00a0is important, he\u00a0said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proactive. We don\u2019t wait until snow comes and try to get rid of it,\u201d Scully saud.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of an art in terms of when you use it and don\u2019t use it,\u201d\u00a0Maurer said.\nMotorists will know that brine has\u00a0been applied\u00a0by the rows of parallel lines\u00a0trucks leave on\u00a0the asphalt. As cars travel over the road, they help to spread out the brine. \u201cIt\u2019s more effective [than salt],\u201d he said.\nDirector of Public Works Robert Scully uses the computer screen on the mobile brine unit to check the levels of brine solution and water that will be mixed in with salt.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey)\nOn Friday, with possible\u00a0snow in the forecast, Scully was busy revving up brine-making operations\u00a0at the\u00a0Department of Public Works facility on\u00a0Goffle\u00a0Road. At a digital programming screen, he\u00a0began\u00a0with making sure\u00a0the brine producer\u00a0was set for maximum effectiveness \u2013 usually a 23.3 percent salt concentration. The mixing of a batch takes place in a giant metal vat at a rate of 160 gallons a minute. Only when the solution reaches the desired concentration does it hit the next stage, which is percolation.\nThe brine solution eventually makes its way to a 900-gallon tank on the back of a truck for easy distribution, but even then, computer sensors are guiding every step. The truck will stick to the goal of 50 gallons of brine per lane mile regardless of whether there\u2019s traffic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all speed sensitive to the roadway,\u201d Scully explained. \u201cWe never go over 20 to 25 mph while brining. The truck knows what\u2019s going on in relation to the roadway.\u201d Hawthorne has 50 miles of roadways.\nA row of evenly spaced applicators creates the lines drivers see on the road\u00a0and are joined by a curbside nozzle for more complete coverage.\nDirector of Public Works Robert Scully looks into the brine tank as it is cleaned with water in preparation for the brine solution that will be made to coat the roads for this weekend's possible storm.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey)\nThe new storage tank will speed up the operation, making it so that trucks from Ridgewood or Passaic County don\u2019t have to wait to get their fill of the brine solution, he said.\nDoes it create potholes? Scully considers the impact on the environment to be less severe than salt operations because the concentration of salt is so reduced.\nAlthough brine-making is in many ways a science, Scully put it simply:\u00a0\u201cIt works.\u201d\n7 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2iuPukV\n"]]

They are also available on matimoo.com and Amazon.com.\nThe symbol\u2019s history\nMany believe the evil eye symbol has the ability to cause injury and death, especially to pregnant women, children and animals. Belief in the eye is prevalent in Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist, Hindu and Christian religions.\n\u201cPeople in Greece are infatuated with the eye, but here\u2019s the thing \u2013 Jewish people will say \u2018it\u2019s the Jewish eye\u2019, Turkish people will say \u2018it\u2019s the Turkish eye\u2019,\u201d says Talieres. \u201cYou can\u2019t specify origin to a particular culture or religion. It\u2019s a universal belief.\u201d\nMeasures to repel the evil eye vary around the world. The tactics range from the use of certain hand gestures to the display of ritual drawings or objects. Widely used is the adornment of amulets, charms or talismans, which represent some form of the eye itself. The staring eye returns the malicious gaze back only to the individual or sorcerer who sent it. It does not cause harm to others who encounter it.\nA symbol and a guardian\nTalieres says she realized the eye\u2019s power when she was in a serious car accident. She walked away without a scratch but the car was practically destroyed. Hanging from her rearview mirror was her evil eye, which she always kept in her car. After the impact of the accident, she looked up and there it was \u2013 fully intact.\n\u201cAt that very moment, I realized it had done its job protecting me,\u201d she says. \u201cI often reflect back to that day and how fortunate I was to survive.\u201d\nHer husband, Mike, believes in the powers of the eye as well, but was never comfortable with wearing anything incorporating the symbol. The options on the market were clunky and cumbersome and many were not fashionable at all. So Talieres, who held a a high ranking job in the fashion retail business, put her knowledge to work and created her own, simplistic and practical line of Mati bracelets. Earlier this year, as Matimoo took off, she quit her job in retail and focused on the power of the Mati full time.\n\u201cIn reality, you sometimes don\u2019t need a $1,000 item to make you feel good,\u201d says Talieres, whose bracelets come in seven different color choices. They are fully adjustable and each one contains a unique eye charm. They sell for just $8.95. \u201cThe mystique of having a statement piece adorned with diamonds isn\u2019t going to buy you extra protection.\u201d\nThere are several components in the manufacturing process of each Matimoo bracelet.\nOne step is the selection of the perfect evil eye bead which must meet quality and aesthetic standards, and also possess individuality and character. Band colors include turquoise, neon pink, neon yellow, black, white red and blue \u2013 red being the top seller. A high quality cord with a wax coating ensures durability. Each bracelet comes with a set of two eyes: one traditional blue and white bead, which sits front and center and on the back side of your wrist sits another metal bead with the evil eye etched in.\n\u201cYou might see variations between the eyes and that\u2019s okay,\u201d says Talieres. \u201cEach eye is meant to have a bit of its own identity.\u201d\nPaying it forward\nAs Talieres feels the eye has protected her, she believes it will watch over all of her customers too. Talieres donates a portion of Matimoo\u2019s sales should go to a cancer charity in honor of her father\u2019s own death by the disease. Bracelets have been donated to a New York City police precinct to help protect the officers on their beat and Matimoo is a participant of Robin\u2019s Racers Vendor Event to aid Making Strides Against Breast Cancer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really our whole mission, and the mission of the evil eye symbol, to help people,\u201d says Talieres. \u201cOur mission at Matimoo is to be able to impact lives throughout many different landscapes.\u201d\nTo order your very own Matimoo bracelet or to find out more about the evil eye, visit matimoo.com .

The city maintains that each of those tenants should have gotten a certificate of occupancy before opening for business.\nBut Michael Rubin, the lawyer representing the owner of the complex, says the city is off-base in its assertion that each tenant in the complex needs a separate certificate of occupancy. He also said municipal officials were overly aggressive in issuing so many violations, especially because the complex is fulfilling local officials\u2019 goal of revising old industrial sites.\n\u201cWho gives 150 summonses to a building that is accomplishing what the city wants to see happen in its historic district?\u201d Rubin wondered.\nRubin said his client, David Garsia, filed the lawsuit last month.\nOfficials said Garsia has been running the complex in violation of the zoning regulations for the area.\n\u201cEvery one of the violations is valid,\u201d said Paterson\u2019s Community Improvements Director David Gilmore, the officials who worked on the summonses. \u201cIt has nothing to do with harassment whatsoever. Everybody who\u2019s in violation is entitled to a ticket.\u201d\nGilmore maintained that each tenant at the complex needs a separate certificate of occupancy. \u201cIt seems to be the common excuse whenever people get caught doing something wrong that they claim harassment,\u201d Gilmore added. \u201cIf they just followed the law, we wouldn\u2019t be knocking on their door.\u201d\nThe city forced the Art Factory complex to shut down in December 2015 \u2013 days before it was going to host a Christmas Party that was supposed to attract hundreds of guests \u2013 because of fire safety violations.\nCity fire officials said those problems were addressed within weeks and the Art Factory was then allowed to reopen. But the shutdown drew attention to the complex and some officials expressed relief that the fire safety problems were found before a tragedy happened.\nGarsia owes more than $600,000 in property taxes on the Art Factory, according to city officials.\n46 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jGuO71\n"]]

PRS asked each chiropractor in an exclusive peer-review online survey which chiropractors they would recommend, other than themselves, across the county. Each chiropractor was allowed to recommend up to three colleagues. Once the ballots were complete, each nominee was carefully evaluated on the basis of the survey results, the legitimacy of their license and their current standing with the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Chiropractors who received the highest number of votes in chiropractic medicine are reflected in the following Top Chiropractor list for 2015. (Note: The opinions are not those of (201), North Jersey Media Group or any of its employees.)\nThis list is a resource for anyone seeking professional chiropractic care, but by no means does it fully represent all of the fine chiropractors in Bergen. The chiropractors selected reflect the confidential opinions of the survey participants. Moreover, voters and honorees chosen in the voting process were not required to advertise. Please join us in congratulating all of the winners.\n"]]

Although these gadgets are sometimes viewed merely as entertainment or for keeping in touch with friends, they can also be used as learning tools to supplement students\u2019 education with classroom- friendly apps.\nComputers, too, are becoming smaller, cheaper and easier to use at school. Some Bergen County districts are moving away frompermanent computer labs toward providing each student their own portable device to use in school and at home.\nGone are the days when pen and paper ruled the land. Now, computers can do almost any task, from writing an essay to submitting it digitally. Overall, it makes sense to use technology as a learning tool, since most children are already tech-literate. A device-friendly classroom has the potential to let students learn better, faster, and more efficiently.\nSMARTPHONES\nThe power of smartphones and tablets lies in the capability to take them anywhere, ready at a moment\u2019s notice. On top of that, apps are available to facilitate nearly any task, from research, to organization, to collaborating with classmates on group projects.\nStudents can download anything from an interactive periodic table app to a graphing calculator. Apps can help them remember when homework is due or create an instant bibliography by scanning a book\u2019s barcode. They can also make room in their backpack by foregoing a dictionary, thesaurus, notebook, language dictionary, flashcards and calendar.\nWhen classrooms allow for the use of smart devices, students can access online research materials or take notes, using the power of the cloud to their advantage.\nBut it\u2019s important that children know and respect the rules of each teacher\u2019s classroom before using a cell phone during class. There are also apps and parental controls that allow parents to keep tabs on their children \u2013 just make sure to give them enough personal space as well.\nLET\u2019S GET PERSONAL\nSome Bergen County schools have already experimented with a technologyintensive classroom experience by distributing iPads, MacBooks or Chromebooks \u2013 essentially Google-powered laptops \u2013 to students. Results have been promising. In the past, schools have relied on computer labs or a limited number of classroom machines, in addition to students\u2019 home computers, for all technological aspects of the curriculum.\nNow students as early as fourth grade have been supplemented with personal devices from local districts, including Allendale, Franklin Lakes, Mahwah, Midland Park, Oakland, Ramsey, Waldwick and Wyckoff.\nBenefits of schools using this one-to-one initiative include filesharing between teachers and students and tracking progress. While the computers haven\u2019t yet completely replaced textbooks, some schools, including Midland Park, have online versions available to students.\nAnother benefit of each student having a computer is that teachers can provide online materials to supplement classroom learning. Notes and lectures can be posted to allow greater collaboration inside and outside the classroom.\nTeachers can easily post and share PowerPoint slides, class notes, web links, syllabi and much more to give students instant access to the entire cache of resources on the cloud, not to mention eliminating the clutter of paper in a messy backpack. Now students can no longer try blaming the dog for eating their homework.\nMore districts are looking into providing personal computers for students, typically only requiring a waiver and nominal fee to cover insurance. So don\u2019t be surprised if your son or daughter comes home from school with a shiny new gadget in their possession.\nAlthough it may seem overwhelming at times, this new use of technology is nothing to fear. Kids are already embracing the latest advancements on a daily \u2013 if not hourly \u2013 basis, so for them, providing a high-tech classroom experience is only natural.\nIn the coming years, who knows what the landscape of education will look like? It is an ever-evolving realm, but rest assured, this generation of kids will use technology to the fullest, becoming better educated than ever.\n"]]

Chris Christie, who has refused to take questions from reporters in New Jersey about the\u00a0George Washington Bridge lane-closure trial, his diminished\u00a0role in the Trump transition and his sweeping plan to combat drug abuse, called in to sports-talk radio Friday afternoon for a breezy 20-minute conversation about football, politics and his future.\nThe conversation ended on an awkward note, though, when Christie was denied \"a little friendly advice\" on how he sounds on the radio.\nChristie selects campaign donor as new ethics watchdog\nHe had been listening to WFAN-660 AM on his way to his youngest daughter's basketball game, Christie\u00a0said, when he felt the urge to call\u00a0host Mike Francesa to talk about the Dallas Cowboys. Francesa turned the focus of the conversation to Christie's relationship with President-elect Donald Trump, which some news outlets have reported has soured in recent weeks.\nChristie, who was ousted as the transition's chairman days after Trump won the election, said reports of a falling-out are \"crazy.\" He said he had been offered \"multiple jobs\" in the new administration, but there was \"about one\" that he really wanted. He didn't say what that job was.\nWhat Trump offered \"weren't jobs that I wanted,\" Christie said. \"There were some that I got offered that were just not worth leaving the governorship for.\"\nWith one year left in office, Christie said, the offer had to be \"a really great job.\"\nListen to the full interview:\u00a0\nMike Francesa with Governor Chris Christie\nOne job Christie has been rumored to be in line for is Francesa's. After 30 years in the afternoon slot at WFAN, the \"sports pope\" is retiring at the end of the year. Christie regularly appears on the station's morning show as a co-host and is set to leave office in January 2018.\nChristie said he has three criteria for whatever his next job may be:\u00a0\"One, I want to\u00a0have fun. Two, I want to make money. And three, I want to be able to spend more time with my kids. That's the way\u00a0I'll look at whatever job it is.\"\nFrancesa asked Christie if he would be open to taking his position.\n\"I'm going to have wide open ears,\" Christie said. \"You don't throw your hat in the ring for that kind of thing. You just see what happens.\"\nWith one year left in his term, Christie said he still looks forward to being governor every day, but conceded\u00a0\"you also count days because it's\u00a0inevitable now.\"\n\"Everyone's going to start running for the job,\" he said.\nAt the end of the conversation, Christie asked Francesa if he would listen to him on the morning show next week. Francesa, who does not get along with morning host Craig Carton,\u00a0said no.\n\"Come on! Why not?\" Christie said.\n\"There's some things I will never do. I don't ever listen in the morning. If you want to come on this show, you're always welcome,\" Francesa told Christie.\n\"Wouldn't you listen to give me a little critique? Come on, a little critique, a little friendly advice,\" Christie said.\nFrancesa again said no.\n\"So you won't even listen when I'm on?\" Christie said.\n\"No. Not even. Sorry,\" Francesa said. \"Some things will never happen.\"\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2itIsgd\n"]]

Will more money flow to New Jersey\u00a0for transportation projects?\nCommuters board a NJ Transit train in this file photo.\n(Photo: Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com)\nAs Trump prepares to assume the nation's highest office, the state's\u00a0infrastructure is in desperate need of some of the $1 trillion Trump has promised toward\u00a0improvements for road, rail and bridges.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised $1 trillion in infrastructure spending in the next 10 years, with much of it going toward\u00a0transportation projects. He also promised that none of the increased spending would come from increased taxes.\nHow Trump would do this, in theory, is by getting private companies to spend the money.\nHis plan is to offer $137 billion in tax credits to construction projects that generate some kind of revenue, such as toll roads and bridges. These credits, his economists say, would generate $167 billion in investment by private companies that could then use the money to borrow up to $1 trillion toward further projects.\nWhile many of Trump's plans are likely to face extreme opposition from Democrats, infrastructure spending is one of the few ideas that might gain support.\nIn an interview in December, Senate Minority Leader Charles\u00a0Schumer, D-N.Y.,\u00a0said he was in favor of heavy infrastructure investment and open to a spending bill.\n\"He's mentioned a trillion dollars. I told him that sounded good to me,\" he said.\nTransportation Trust Fund\nIn 2016, New Jersey's Transportation Trust Fund nearly went broke\nIn 2016,\u00a0the New Jersey's Transportation Trust Fund nearly went broke and\u00a0Gov. Chris Christie temporarily shut\u00a0down construction on most state-funded transportation projects. The work resumed after the approval of the 23 cents-per-gallon gas tax increase, which went into effect in November and which voters dedicated solely to transportation projects on the Nov. 8 ballot.\nThe gas tax increase\u00a0offers a mild but temporary solution to some of the state's infrastructure problems. Gas tax revenues and new borrowing will increase from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion a year, but $334 million of the $400 million in new revenue will go toward paying off old debts.\nNew Jersey received an infrastructure grade of D+ in 2016 from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which was highly critical of the state's roads, bridges, levees and public transit systems.\nBridges\nBridges, roads and levees across the state are decaying\nNearly one in 10 of New Jersey's 6,657 bridges is structurally deficient, meaning a bridge has one or more structural defects that need attention. More than 40 percent of the state roadway system is either rough, distressed or cracked, and costs drivers nearly $2,000 per year, according to 2012 data. Of the 10 levees inspected by the Army Corps of Engineers, half were deemed unacceptable and the other half were only minimally acceptable.\nPublic transportation\nThe system is near capacity and expansion will require federal funds\nNew Jersey's public transit systems, in particular, are under enormous strain as ridership between New Jersey and New York has continued to increase. With trains and buses nearing capacity, major expansions are needed to keep up with demand. Projects like a new Port Authority Bus Terminal or the Gateway Project, which would expand capacity and add two\u00a0rail tracks under the Hudson River, require massive investments of federal funding.\nMore Topics\n"]]

He vowed to build a wall at the Mexican border to prevent immigrants from entering the country illegally. He also pledged to deport millions of undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions and to reverse policies put in place by President Barack Obama that shield from deportation unauthorized\u00a0immigrants who came to the country as children. He also said he would ban Muslim refugees from entering the country.\nA border patrol agent riding along the iron fence that separates Douglas, Arizona, and Agua Prieta, Mexico, along the international border in 2006.\n(Photo: AP FILE PHOTO)\nNew Jersey is home to a diverse population, with more than\u00a01 in 5 residents being foreign born, and half of thosebeing naturalized U.S. citizens, according to a report by the American Immigration Council. The Garden State is also home to approximately 500,000 people who don't have legal resident status, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The forced removal of immigrants living in the country illegally would cause New Jersey to lose $25.9 billion in annual economic activity, according to a report by New Jersey Policy Perspective.\nThose who support Trump's proposed immigration\u00a0policies argue that immigration laws mustbe upheld and that people\u00a0living in the country illegally should not receive benefits such as work authorizations.\nBorder Protection\n'The Wall'\nThere's\u00a0about 400 miles along the U.S.-Mexican\u00a0border\u00a0where new fencing could be erected, and during the campaign, Trump vowed to build a wall that Mexico would pay for. Last week, news outlets reported that Trump intends to ask Congress for the initial funds to build the wall. Trump has also talked about increasing aerial surveillance programs at the border and adding more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. New Jersey is home to\u00a0immigrants\u00a0who have crossed the border fleeing violence, and seeking economic and education opportunities, including children who have crossed the border unaccompanied.\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Close\n23,000 New Jersey residents approved for 'DACA' Waiver\nMore than 800,000 immigrants\u00a0who came to the United States as children and\u00a0live in the country without legal permission have received this temporary waiver from deportation. The immigration policy was created in 2012\u00a0through an executive order by President Barack Obama and could be rescinded\u00a0under the\u00a0Trump administration. About\u00a023,000 New Jersey residents have been approved for the waiver, which has allowed them go to college and to work.\nRefugees\nMany fleeing violence of Syrian civil war\nTrump called for a ban on refugees from countries like Syria and Libya because he fears that terrorists could try to sneak in through the refugee\u00a0program. Last year, President Obama\u00a0pledged to increase the number of refugees that the U.S. accepts by 30 percent this year. The U.S. has been preparing to take in 110,000 refugees, including many\u00a0from\u00a0Syria, where a 5-year-old civil war has led 4.8 million\u00a0people to flee the country.\nMass deportation of immigrants with criminal records\nAn estimated 2 to 3 million face removal\nDays after winning the election,\u00a0Trump, in an interview with \"60 Minutes,\" said he would prioritize the deportation of 2 to 3 million immigrants living in the country without permission who have criminal records. Under Obama's administration, more than 2.7\u00a0million\u00a0\"removals\" occurred between fiscal year 2009 and 2014, according to Department of Homeland Security statistics. After Trump's\u00a0win, advocates who help immigrant detainees reported receiving calls from those worried about their future.\nVisas for tech workers\n65,000 workers admitted into U.S. annually\nThe H-1B visa program \u2013\u00a0which allows foreign\u00a0workers, including scientists, engineers and computer programmers,\u00a0to enter the United States for employment \u2013\u00a0could be curbed under a Trump administration. The U.S. admits an annual 65,000 workers and 20,000 graduate students with the visas. Once someone has obtained the visa, it can be renewed. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, whom Trump has tapped as his attorney general, has been a critic of the visa program and has introduced legislation to limit the number of visas available to\u00a0outsourcing companies. Trump has said he opposes outsourcing workers and wants to ensure that available jobs are offered to American workers first. Critics of the visa program\u00a0say it replaces skilled workers in the United States with foreigners who get paid less.\nSanctuary cities\nPassaic, North Bergen among several in N.J.\nTrump said he wants to withhold federal\u00a0funding from\u00a0sanctuary cities \u2013\u00a0communities that\u00a0limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities that could lead to the deportation of unauthorized immigrants living in their towns. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Union, Burlington, Ocean and Middlesex counties have such \"sanctuary'' policies.

I'm becoming president.\"\n01/15/2017 08:39 am ET\n34k\nMary Papenfuss Trends reporter, The Huffington Post\nAlec Baldwin stepped into Donald Trump\u2019s shoes again for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d to present his own version of the president-elect\u2019s recent press conference \u00a0and talk about inauguration entertainment, golden showers and his sons, \u201cBeavis\u201d and \u201cButthead.\u201d\nBaldwin as Trump begins in the cold open with a serious warning: \u201cLet me answer the question that\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind: Yes this is real life, this is really happening. On January 20th, I, Donald J. Trump will become the 45th president of the United States. Then two months later Mike Pence will become the 46th.\u201d\nHe says he\u2019s excited to move into the White House, and will even have a \u201clittle\u201d pet: Paul Ryan.\n\u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) January 15, 2017\n\u201cWho is excited for my Inauguration Day?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe have got some of the biggest performers in the world lined up. Hold on to your tits and bits, because we have got Three Doors Down, Jackie What\u2019s-her-face from \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d and the one Rockette with the least money in her savings.\u201d He also touts \u201chuge A-List actors coming, like Angelina Jolie, Ryan Gosling and Jennifer Lawrence\u00a0... courtesy of Madame Tussauds\u201d waxworks.\nTrump on his inauguration line-up. #SNL pic.twitter.com/5vrij0OUUd\n\u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) January 15, 2017\nHe then takes questions from \u201creporters,\u201d but refuses to answer any\u00a0\u201cpee pee party\u201d questions, referring to an unsubstantiated report of a \u201cgolden shower\u201d sex fete in Russia, saying: \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen and It wasn\u2019t as cool as it sounds.\u201d But he can\u2019t quite steer away from golden shower images as he talks about his plan to bring a \u201cthick stream of jobs\u201d to the country.\u00a0\u201cThis country will literally be showered with jobs. Because I\u2019m a major wiz at jobs,\u201d he gushes.\nWhen a reporter tells him people \u201ccould die\u201d if he eliminates Obamacare without a replacement, leaving 20 million people without health insurance, Baldwin\u2019s Trump answers: \u201cListen, sweetheart, I\u2019m about to be president. We\u2019re all going to die.\u201d\nHe also announces that he has\u00a0\u201c turned over all my business to my two sons, Beavis and Butthead.\u201d\u00a0Gesturing to SNL cast members Mikey Day and Alex Moffat, playing Donald Jr.\u00a0and Eric, Baldwin adds: \u201cLook at those two little American psychos.\u201d He refuses to take a question from a reporter from the \u201cfailing pile of garbage\u201d BuzzFeed or from \u201cover-rated fake news\u201d CNN, though insists repeatedly: \u201cI respect the press.\u201d\u00a0\nThe last question comes from shirtless Vladimir Putin look-alike Beck Bennett (claiming to be Wolf Blitzer) who asks Trump if he\u2019s \u201cvery very sure\u201d Russia hacked the American presidential election, while he holds up a small video labeled \u201cpee pee tape.\u201d\n\u201cIt was China,\u201d Baldwin responds. \u201cNo, it was Canada. OK, It was Meryl Streep.\u201d\u00a0He wraps it up with the sendoff: \u201cThanks for peeing here.\u201d\nBefore the Trump skewering, \u201cSNL\u201d re-aired a 1978 episode featuring Carrie Fisher not long after she rocked the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie as Princess Leia. She opened the show dressed as Leia. Musical guests were the Blues Brothers: Dan Aykroyd and the late great John Belushi.\nTina Fey returned to 8H* with a special message for Felicity Jones. #SNL\n*as a hologram pic.twitter.com/LqqSQrSpM2\n\u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) January 15, 2017\nSaturday night\u2019s episode was hosted by \u201cRogue One\u201d actress Felicity Jones, who was joined in the opening monologue by an ersatz \u201chologram\u201d of Tina Fey as Princess Leia. Fey warned Jones:\u00a0\u201cNo matter how the show goes, the president of the United States will say that it\u2019s sad and overrated,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s fine, no one cares.\u201d\nRelated Coverage\n"]]

We are extremely grateful to the millions of families who have made Ringling Bros. part of their lives for generations.\u201d\n. @RinglingBros will hold its final performances in May of this year. Details: https://t.co/Z4iQLxI0Sh #RinglingBros\n\u2014 Ringling Bros. (@RinglingBros) January 15, 2017\nLast year, the circus retired its elephants to its conservation farm in Florida amid continuing protests about animals in the show. But once the elephants were gone, the demand for tickets dropped even more dramatically, according to Feld.\nCompany officials told workers Saturday night after shows in Orlando and Miami.\nRingling Bros. has two touring circuses that will perform 30 shows between now and May. Stops will include Atlanta, Philadelphia, Boston, Brooklyn and Washington, D.C. The final shows will be in Providence, Rhode Island, on May 7 and in Uniondale, New York, at the Nassau County Coliseum on May 21.\nGustavo Caballero/Getty Images\nNot so happy any longer. Workers in Miami were told Saturday night that the show is closing forever in May.\nIt\u2019s been a long, colorful road of clowns, trapeze artists in sparkly spandex, dancing elephants and surly tigers. Phineas Taylor Barnum went on the road in the mid-1800s with his traveling spectacle of animals and human oddities, and the five Ringling brothers began performing juggling acts and skits from their home base in Baraboo, Wisconsin, in 1884. They merged in 1919 to tour together as \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth.\u201d The Ringling family ran the circus until 1967 then sold it to Feld Entertainment.\nTechnology brought competition from movies and TV, video games and the internet, and animal activists and members of the public became increasingly concerned about treatment of the animals on the road and in the acts.\n\u201cThe competitor in many ways is time ,\u201d Feld told The Associated Press, adding that transporting the show by rail and other circus quirks \u2014 such as providing a traveling school for performers\u2019 children \u2014 are throwbacks to another era that couldn\u2019t compete with modern fare. \u201cIt\u2019s a different model that we can\u2019t see how it works in today\u2019s world to justify and maintain an affordable ticket price. So you\u2019ve got all these things working against it.\u201d\nThe Felds say their existing animals \u2014 lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas \u2014 will go to suitable homes. Feld\u2019s daughter, Chief Operating Officer Juliette Feld, said the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation.\nFeld Entertainment will also continue to produce its other, profitable, shows\u2014 Monster Jam, Disney on Ice and Marvel Live\u00a0\u2014 and will attempt to place some circus workers in those operations.\n\u00a0\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misstated that the Ringling brothers began performing in Wisconsin in 1984. They began in 1884.\nRelated Coverage\n"]]

Wochit\nPoster for Hillsdale native Geremy Jasper's \"Patti Cake$.\"\n(Photo: Jeong Park)\nPatricia Dombrowski is an aspiring rapper from New Jersey, a woman in a male-dominated industry on a journey to find her artistic voice. The lead character in Hillsdale native Geremy Jasper\u2019s feature film debut \u201cPatti Cake$\u201d breaks the mold of what a rapper is and could be, according to Jasper. It\u2019s no laughable fish-out-of-water story.\n\u201cThe film isn\u2019t like \u2018Oh, isn\u2019t it funny that this Jersey girl wants to be a rapper too?\u2019\u201d said the Pascack Valley High School graduate, who wrote and directed the film and created the original music. \u201cIt\u2019s not that at all. It\u2019s like \u2018Wow, she's really good.\u2019 The film is about a real poet, or artist, who doesn\u2019t really know that\u2019s who she is but is finding her voice throughout this huge, surreal adventure that she goes on.\u201d\n\u201cPatti Cake$\u201d is being hailed as a film to watch at Robert Redford\u2019s influential\u00a0Sundance Film Festival, which opens in Park City, Utah, on Thursday. Jasper was named one of the 10 directors to watch this year by Variety, and the film is getting a lot of buzz.\nTV:\u00a0West Milford HS grad to star in TV's 'Street Science'\nThe week before the festival, Trevor Groth, its director of programming, told the Park Record newspaper of Park City\u00a0that he expects \u201cPatti Cake$\u201d and its title character, played by Australian actress Danielle Macdonald,\u00a0to be one of the highlights.\n\u201cShe\u2019s really such a singular character that you haven\u2019t seen on film before,\u201d Groth said. \u201cYou just fall in love with her and root for her.\u201d\nThe longshot from the Garden State is in good company.\n\u201cI feel like Patti is [part of] a long lineage of underdog N.J. musicians,\u201d he said before listing many, including Frank Sinatra, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith and Naughty by Nature. \u201cAnd now Patti Dombrowski.\u201d\nHillsdale native Geremy Jasper says his film \"Patti Cake$\" reflects his growing up in a family that modeled and valued strong, independent women.\n\u00a0(Photo: Jeremiah Zagar)\nThe film premieres on Jan.\u00a023. Later that week, Jasper will be part of a Sundance panel discussion entitled \u201cAre We All the Other: Transcending Boundaries in Storytelling,\u201d about \u201ctraversing boundaries of genre, gender, race\u00a0and class in creating their work.\u201d It is presented by Women at Sundance and the Sundance Institute Diversity Initiatives.\nFor Jasper, though, writing a strong female character wasn\u2019t a stretch. \u00a0He grew up in a family that modeled and valued strong, independent women.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family basically of all guys except for my mother [Lois], who is a very strong, very, very cool lady,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s got a very strong personality and she doesn\u2019t take any crap from anybody and definitely knows who she is.\u201d\nHis dad, Jeff, concurs.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a feminist from whenever,\u201d said Jeff, known to local sports fans as the highly successful\u00a0longtime coach of the Pascack Valley High School girls basketball team. \u201cShe\u2019s just that kind of woman. Independent. Opinionated.\u00a0My mother was like that. My wife is exactly like that. I coach my team, and always have, exactly the same way. They\u2019re just great athletes, who happen to be girls, playing basketball.\u201d\nIt was not only Lois, but also Jeff\u2019s players who influenced Geremy.\n\u201cBeing raised around these female athletes from the time that I was born, they were always sort of a phenomenon growing up and were my heroes growing up\u00a0\u2013\u00a0all the players on my dad\u2019s team(s),\u201d Geremy Jasper said.\n\u201cI think that had a big influence on why writing a film about someone like Patti just came so naturally to me and was interesting to me. You think of hip-hop as a male-dominated art form, genre, you would say the same thing about basketball, at least back in the day. It\u2019s changed a lot now thanks to people like my dad.\u201d\nJasper with his dad, Jeff.\n\u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of Jeff Jasper)\nJasper grew up around sports but also with a love of cartooning and music. Some might think that to be an arts-obsessed kid in a sports-centric family would be difficult, but that\u2019s not how it was with the Jaspers.\n\u201cIt was cool,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents are pretty amazing. They were always supportive of what I wanted to do and what my interests were. So there was never much, never much rebelling I could do. I could be pretty wild in my day, but it didn\u2019t really faze them as long as I wasn\u2019t being nasty.\u201d\nHe found rap and hip-hop in elementary school and became obsessed, by his own admission, trying to spit out his own rhymes in the fifth grade talent show. Later, his act would get slightly more controversial.\n\u201cIt was the '90s, so I was wearing my mom\u2019s dresses onstage, then I would take it off and be in my underwear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got thrown off the stage and I got in a lot of trouble with the vice principal and there was a lot of controversy. But [my parents] were always cool and knew that I was the eccentric one in the family and that the Jaspers have a long line of eccentrics in the family tree, so they knew how to deal with me.\u201d\nJasper with his mom, Lois.\n\u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of Jeff Jasper)\nSaid Jeff, \u201cDid he cross the line maybe on occasion? I think his mother would say he did. I\u2019m going to say he probably never did. He\u2019s been a sense of joy forever.\u201d\nGeremy was an athlete too, though. All-county football and quite a good basketball player in his own right, his dad points out. But after his junior year, he decided he wanted to stop playing basketball.\n\u201cNow, you can imagine how that could play in my life,\u201d the elder Jasper said, laughing.\nLois, whom the son told first, told him to go have the conversation with his dad.\n\u201cHe was so prepared,\u201d said Jeff. \u201cCertainly I wasn\u2019t going to stop him, but I did want to know what was his substitute, what was he going to do. He said, \u2018I\u2019ve got my music.\u00a0I\u2019ve got the band. I\u2019ve got ideas. I need to write and to read.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a lot better.\u2019\n\u201cHe always had a vision. He always had a path, and he was willing to work for it.\u201d\nAll these years later, Geremy, now 41, is still working hard to bring his visions to fruition and is getting quite a bit of attention for it. He has played in bands, recorded, toured and now found a love for film and throwing himself into it as he has everything else along the way.\n\u201cAs you could imagine, I can\u2019t be prouder of what he\u2019s done,\u201d Jeff Jasper said. \u201cHe had his dream and he just pursued it, so that\u2019s the thing to me that makes me just really stand up and take notice of him. It\u2019s not the accolades that have come or the fact that all these other people, the critics or whoever, they think that he\u2019s incredibly talented. We know he\u2019s always been talented.\u201d\n"]]

His mission:\u00a0to conduct what has come to be known as \u201copposition research\u201d \u2013 collecting unflattering or embarrassing information on opponents.\nHe doubled his salary. In case you wondered.\nI thought of this career switch in the wake of the recent revelations of salacious and unverified reports that President-elect Donald Trump supposedly cavorted with prostitutes in Russia and also engaged in real estate deals that could have been perceived as bribes.\u00a0The man behind these revelations is another former journalist who made the same career switch as the investigative reporter I knew. He became an opposition researcher. He was paid handsomely.\u00a0They all are.\nUSA TODAY:\u00a0 Trump team ponders changes for White House press corps\nThe information about Trump \u2013\u00a0while never verified, and denied extensively and forcefully by the president-elect and his aides \u2013\u00a0was nevertheless deemed so important by U.S. intelligence officials \u2013 including the heads of the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency \u2013\u00a0that it was included in recent briefings with Trump and President Barack Obama.\u00a0It did not matter that this information might be false. Truthful or not, the intelligence chiefs felt it had taken on a life of its own and could place Trump in a compromised position in future dealings with foreign nations, especially Russia.\nKeep in mind that intelligence briefings with presidents \u2013 and president-elects \u2013 are not supposed to be gossip sessions.\u00a0They are designed to focus on deeply serious matters such as specific terrorist threats to America, the latest nuclear gambit by North Korea, or suspicious activity by Iran, China or other nations that\u00a0yearn to flex their muscles.\u00a0This may be the first time in U.S. history that American spy chiefs found themselves assessing the threat level of Russian prostitutes. Somewhere, James Bond must be laughing.\nConsider the larger context, though. With U.S. intelligence agencies already finding conclusive proof that Russia was behind a Bond-like scheme to hack into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and disrupt the 2016 presidential election, you can understand why American officials might be concerned about these additional revelations, even if they had not been proved. Like it or not, we now live in a world where fact and fiction co-exist on the Internet and \u201cfake news\u201d is now part of America\u2019s political dialogue.\nBut an uncomfortable question lurked on the fringes of this latest story:\u00a0How did these allegations first surface?\nThe answer is disturbing.\u00a0A former journalist for The\u00a0Wall Street Journal, with substantial credentials as an investigative reporter, had switched careers \u2013 just like the journalist I knew \u2013 and was now running a high-priced private firm that specialized in \u201copposition research.\u201d\nThe firm was hired by wealthy Republicans to dig up dirt on Trump \u2013 and came up with the story of the Russian prostitutes.\u00a0Later, with all sorts of warning flags about its lack of verification, the story was passed\u00a0to Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign. It was then circulated widely among journalists who covered Washington and the presidential campaign.\nIn other words, this information \u2013 truthful or not \u2013 was essentially passed into the public sphere.\u00a0 Just like high school gossip, it was only a matter of time before it leaked to a wider audience.\nThere are many additional details to this story \u2013 for instance, the role of a former British spy with extensive contacts in Russia who was hired to\u00a0help the former-Journal-reporter-turned-opposition-researcher find compromising information about Trump.\u00a0But let\u2019s return to the chief foot soldier in this caper \u2013 the former journalist and what his career switch means for the media as a whole.\nWhat was his motive?\u00a0And what sort of ethical lines did he draw when he left journalism but took his investigative skills into politics?\nI\u2019ve been lucky.\u00a0I never really wanted to be anything besides a journalist and storyteller.\u00a0I also know, however, that some of the same journalistic skills that I take for granted in shaping the stories I write could be seen as extremely valuable in other fields, commanding perhaps a ridiculously high salary.\nI know, for instance, how to search public records \u2013 how to find all manner of information that most people prefer to remain hidden, such as arrest records, college grades and unlisted phone numbers.\u00a0Hearing once how I tracked the whereabouts of a fugitive who had eluded law enforcement officials for years, a former FBI agent said, \u201cYou should have been a cop.\u201d\nI laughed heartily.\u00a0Me with a gun and handcuffs?\u00a0No way.\u00a0But the point is that journalists often develop the same skills used by all manner of investigators, including those who catch crooks.\u00a0In modern politics, with its reliance on negative TV advertising and opposition research, those skills translate into big paychecks.\nNow those skills are at the root of the latest crisis in journalism \u2013 and politics.\nTrump and his allies have accused some of America\u2019s most notable media outlets of irresponsibly reporting the unproven and deeply salacious claims about Trump and Moscow prostitutes.\u00a0Whether this becomes a political crisis remains to be seen.\u00a0Like it or not, it\u2019s already a crisis for journalism and, more broadly, how America traffics in information now.\nFor journalists, however, the questions strike at some of our most basic pillars. How do we remain credible as responsible storytellers\u00a0if we can easily switch careers and slip into the big-bucks world of opposition research?\u00a0As journalists, we continually remind ourselves of our ethical stake in trying to verify what we report.\u00a0We\u2019re not perfect \u2013 certainly, this columnist has made his share of mistakes. But the standards are clear, especially at The Record and most other news organizations.\u00a0If you knowingly traffic in false information \u2013 or invent facts \u2013 you will likely get fired.\u00a0On the spot. Think of it as a summary execution on a battlefield.\nWhat about opposition research that routinely traffics falsehoods and invented facts?\u00a0No one has been fired yet for the latest allegations about Trump.\u00a0Don\u2019t hold your breath.\nI\u2019m not a fan of Trump.\u00a0Regular readers of this column should know that.\u00a0But fair is fair.\u00a0And as I watched him conduct a surreal news conference in which he juggled pronouncements about serious national policy issues such as health care with the allegations about the Russian prostitutes, I wondered what sort of presidency he had inherited \u2013 and, frankly, what it meant for America.\nTrump is hardly innocent.\u00a0Remember the recording of him bragging about groping women?\u00a0Or the radio interview in which he chortled about his daughter\u2019s body?\u00a0Or those tabloid headlines years ago about his alleged sexual prowess? The man walks a dangerous line.\nSurely\u00a0many Trump critics are cheering this latest dilemma for him. But just think back to the false allegations against Hillary Clinton, and you\u2019ll see the danger of cheering when your side wins and complaining when you lose.\nTruth inspires and uplifts.\nLies drag us all down.\nJournalism needs to remind itself of its better angels \u2013 and the right path.\u00a0It needs to do this soon.\nEmail Mike Kelly at:\u00a0 kellym@northjersey.com\nTwitter:\u00a0@MikeKellyColumn\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Wednesday.\n\u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)\n21 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2ipUWW8\n"]]

(AP Photo/Mel Evans)\n(Photo: Mel Evans, AP)\nIt was the week of two Chris Christies.\nOn Monday, the neo-liberal Chris Christie was back on the job, creating 20 new judgeships and signing off on their\u00a0$9.3 million tab. He praised\u00a0the state Judiciary that he once bashed as an unaccountable, elite enclave of liberal activism.\nOn Tuesday, in his State of the State speech, he called for an Obamcare-style health insurance mandate, praised the expansion of Medicaid\u00a0and vowed a crusade against the scourge of drug addiction.\nGOVERNOR:\u00a0Christie, silent in New Jersey, calls in to N.Y. sports radio to talk Cowboys and Trump\nBut on Wednesday morning, Christie swerved to the right. He was back in 2016 presidential campaign mode, on the couch at \u201cFox and Friends\u201d running damage control for President-elect Donald J. Trump, and defending Jeff Sessions, the attorney general nominee who has come under fierce criticism from the nation\u2019s largest civil rights groups.\n\u201cJeff Sessions is \u2026 a really, really good person who has a great career in public service and who I have complete confidence in as the backbone to do what\u2019s necessary as attorney general. All of the rest of this stuff is just theater,\u2019\u2019 Christie told the show hosts. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do a good job as attorney general.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the new duality of Chris Christie in his lame-duck year as governor. Christie appears to be trying to regain traction and redeem his credibility on the Jersey home front, treading down the center-left lane of Main Street, collaborating with and \u2013 at times\u00a0\u2013 backslapping the Democrats he once disdained.\nAnd then there is still the national Chris Christie, still trying to wedge his foot in the door of the new Trump administration, a door that appeared to be slammed in his face. On television last week, he cast himself as the stand-by-your-man loyalist, despite his reputation as a being a Party of One, a poor team player who is largely out for his own interest.\nChristie is well-regarded as a skilled political actor who knows how to play to the audience in front of him. But his split personality last week\u00a0reflects, to a certain extent, a new kind of career anxiety for the once-surefooted Christie. Not since his\u00a0first political career debacle \u2013 being bounced off the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders\u00a0after one tumultuous term \u2013 has Christe faced such an uncertain future.\nHe rebounded after that freeholder term, raising money for George W. Bush\u2019s campaign in 2000, for which Bush rewarded him by raising him out of the abyss, and naming him U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a job that would catapult him to prominence. From there, Christie carefully climbed to the State House\u00a0and, then, methodically set his sights on the White House.\nBut now\u00a0he\u2019s a lame duck, no longer one of the promising Republican stars cheered by the Koch brothers and celebrated by Henry Kissinger. He\u2019s a\u00a0scandal-scarred, sixth-place finisher in the 2016 contest, facing hostile glares from New Jersey residents who resented his absenteeism. After the November election, he was dumped from the Trump transition team and denied an escape from Trenton.\nGov. Chris Christie appears to be trying to work with a Democratic state and keep his hand in with the Trump administration, just in case.\n\u00a0(Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com)\nNow, at 54 years old, Christie might not be entirely sure where to go next.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know where his political future lies, which is a first for him in 15 years, at least,\u2019\u2019 said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University poll and a political analyst. \u201cHe has always been pretty certain what the trajectory [was] he was going to take. And that all collapsed beneath him.\u201d\nThe split personality was on full display during Christie\u2019s State of the State speech. The early part of the speech was a recitation of his conservative talking points \u2013 the cutting of 10,000 state jobs without layoffs, negotiating a one-cent cut in the sales tax while scuttling the tax on estates, and the expansion of charter schools under his watch.\nYet\u00a0he sharply veered to the left of center, boasting of his 2013 decision to accept the federal government\u2019s offer to vastly expand Medicaid, a cornerstone of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which Republicans in Congress are moving to repeal. He then called on legislative leaders to swiftly enact\u00a0a law mandating insurance companies to provide coverage for the first six months of drug treatment. Conservatives despise government mandates.\n\u201cMiddle-class families living the nightmare of addiction of a loved one do not deserve the double dose of agony \u2013 denial by an insurance company leading to the death of a loved one,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nAnd with his vow to spend his final year\u00a0in office crusading against the opioid epidemic \u2013 by creating a clearinghouse website, re-designating more treatment beds for young adults,\u00a0and expanding campus housing for students in recovery \u2013 Christie was embracing policies that liberal Democrats advocated more than a generation ago.\n"]]

No. 1 on the current power rankings is Clint Frazier, the Yankees\u2019 can\u2019t-miss prospect who\u2019s blessed with bat speed, charisma and a Look At Me ego. The kid is ready to conquer the universe.\nFrazier recently spoke to the New York Post on a variety of subjects, including his excitement about becoming a Yankee (he was acquired in the deal that sent Andrew Miller to the Indians), the Stadium\u2019s short porch (Frazier bats righty with opposite-field power) and making a quick leap from Class-AAA (where he\u2019ll start the season) to the Bronx.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to pound the ball into those right-field seats,\u201d Frazier told the Post\u2019s Kevin Kernan. Bravo, I already love him. Frazier has the personality of a young Reggie and could be the face of the Yankees\u2019 renaissance in 2018.\nSo here we go.\n\u201cI play like my hair is on fire,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cIt\u2019s fiery, like my personality. It\u2019s big hair, and I try to make my personality big. I think it represents me because it\u2019s different, I\u2019m different, it\u2019s unique to who I am. It makes me one of a kind.\u2019\u2019\nKlapisch: What can the Mets expect from Matt Harvey?\nThe words, the urgency, jump out at you \u2014 clearly Frazier craves the attention. Hopefully he\u2019s smart enough to know hype isn\u2019t free. Tell the world you\u2019re ready to be great and you immediately become a target. Frazier better be ready to back it up, but one way or another his career arc will be fascinating.\nAnd here\u2019s another caveat Frazier will soon realize. The day he walks into the Yankees clubhouse he becomes part of Joe Girardi\u2019s matrix. The manager is as serious and corporate as Joe Maddon is hip. \"Watch what you say\" is the first lesson Girardi imparts to his younger players.\nJoe Girardi.\n\u00a0(Photo: associated press)\nGary Sanchez plays by those rules. So do Dellin Betances and Luis Severino. Frazier won\u2019t just have to cut his big red hair; he might have to lower the temperature on those quotes, as well. It\u2019s been a long time since any Yankee sounded like Reggie, which is why Frazier\u2019s new friendship with Jackson is too good to be true: One channels the other.\nMr. October mentored Frazier this fall during the Instructional League, cautioning him to cut down on his swing. Only 22, Frazier is prone to trying too hard. But scouts say the kid\u2019s power is real: He swatted 16 home runs in 463 at-bats at Class-AA and Class-AAA last year. GM Brian Cashman described Frazier\u2019s bat speed as \u201clegendary.\u201d\nThe downside? There were 122 strikeouts, more than one in every four at-bats, which Frazier will address in his first full season in the Yankees\u2019 organization. But he\u2019s already enjoying the attention.\nIn just the last few weeks Frazier has traded tweets with Bryce Harper about having to trim his hair, per Yankees rules. Frazier told Harper, \u201cit\u2019s worth it to one day wear those pinstripes my man #Roadto28.\u201d\nFrazier said he was referring to his own locks, not Harper\u2019s, but it nevertheless appeared he was recruiting the Nationals\u2019 slugger, who\u2019ll be a free agent after 2018. That\u2019s quite a conversation, considering Harper out-ranked Frazier in every way \u2014 performance, service time and star power.\nStill, I don\u2019t think Frazier intentionally overstepped his bounds. He\u2019s just refreshingly unafraid to engage. Good for him. Baseball needs more players who speak their minds. These days, by the time they\u2019ve worked their way through the farm system, most young stars have been turned into media-trained bots \u2014 they don't say or think anything that hasn\u2019t already been stamped into their frontal lobes.\nBut not Frazier. During the interview with the Post, Frazier said,\u00a0\u201cI do swing for the fences. I talk a big game, I better back it up soon. I think I know how to excite people. I made a joke on Twitter the other day that I am my own hype man, I don\u2019t need somebody else to hype me up. My competitive nature fuels me.\u201d\nThere was more.\n\u201cI know I can bring a lot to the table,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cI want my table to be full of polished parts.\u201d\nAnd this.\n\u201cThe mentality I bring to the game is \u2018I\u2019m going to get this done.\u2019 \u201d\nPrediction: This is going to be fun.\nBet the house on this, too: Girardi is already cringing.\nA last thought on Wally Backman\nMets fans seem divided on Backman\u2019s indictment of Sandy Alderson, whom he accused of blackballing his efforts to find a job in professional baseball in the U.S. Backman is headed to Mexico to manage in 2017, but only because he\u2019s sure the Mets\u2019 GM has sabotaged him within the industry.\nWhile I don\u2019t believe Alderson would go that far \u2014 and he certainly didn\u2019t call 29 other teams to denounce Backman \u2014 there\u2019s been enough bad-mouthing going on. It didn\u2019t have to come from Alderson, but other teams were still aware of the differences between the GM and Backman. The net effect has been the same.\nToo bad, because Backman\u2019s players have always sworn by him. He worked hard and was mostly successful in his seven years with the Mets. And despite his rogue past, Backman stayed out of trouble while in the Mets\u2019 employ.\nWhat doomed him was that 80s-era personality \u2014 raw and unfiltered \u2014 which always made Alderson uncomfortable. That shouldn\u2019t be enough to keep Backman out of work, though. He deserves better.\n"]]

Wochit\nRick Green, Editor of The Record\n(Photo: FILE)\nThe eyes of the world will be on Washington, D.C., on Friday\u00a0 when Donald J. Trump becomes the nation\u2019s 45th president.\nAfter a contentious campaign cycle and a post-election/pre-inauguration period that only can be described as intriguing, one fact is certain after noon next Friday: A new administration, touching the everyday lives of all Americans, rolls into action.\nHere\u2019s the question we are asking at The Record and NorthJersey.com: What effects will this new Trump administration have on the lives and livelihoods of New Jersey\u2019s residents, taxpayers, businesses \u2013 big and small \u2013 and its children?\nTo help answer that question, we have launched a four-year series we call \u201cTrump Tracker.\u201d We're rolling out the pieces of the series digitally in the days leading up to the inauguration.\nIts aim is simple: We will follow 14 issues critical to all corners of New Jersey that could be affected by the decisions, actions and efforts of President Trump\u2019s administration.\nRAIL:\u00a0Repairing, upgrading rail would impact thousands of commuters\nUsing government data, public records and other research from a wide array of experts and sources, it will measure changes and trends on health care, immigration, transportation, job creation, the military, New Jersey\u2019s political influence, energy and the environment, regulations, the Newark seaport, infrastructure, passenger rail, taxes, homeland security and the state\u2019s social safety net.\nWhy now, you may ask?\nObviously, a Trump White House comes at a momentous chapter in American history \u2013 with swirling questions about foreign alliances, national security and international hotspots, as well as an uncertain economy, climate change and the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. These (and others) are important areas that deserve close monitoring.\nIt also casts the appropriate spotlight not on Candidate Trump and the campaign\u2019s exhausting and controversial political gamesmanship, but on President Trump \u2013 his leadership, decisions and the actions of his administration.\nAdditionally, the tracker\u2019s debut coincides with the national conversation of \u201cfake news\u201d and readers\u2019 suspicion of reporters, not to mention President-elect Trump\u2019s tirades against many in the media. I view this series as smart, insightful and much-needed analysis that only an independent news organization can produce. It will be done in a fair, unbiased manner built around well-sourced data and expert analysis.\nThe presidency of Donald J. Trump undoubtedly will impact life for all who call New Jersey home \u2013 just as the exiting Obama administration and its predecessors did.\nI invite you to journey with us as we watch these next four years unfold and track how new, modified or discontinued policies affect all of us.\nThanks for reading The Record and North Jersey.com.\nRick Green is editor and vice president of news.

Lee mayor targeted?\nBuy this photo\nCARMINE GALASSO / STAFF PHOTOGRPAHER\nFort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich speaking outside city during a press conference Friday, May 1, 2015, after indictments were announced by the U.S. Attorney in the GWB investigation.\nBy Mike Kelly\nThe Record\nMike Kelly is a Record columnist. Contact him at kellym@northjersey.com.\nTHEY KEPT lists of names on computerized spreadsheets as if they were charting stock tips. They made phone calls after hours. They even consulted a lawyer to check whether they violated ethics rules.\nAn in-depth look at the scandal over the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge and related aftershocks. Click here to launch .\nThis was the heart of an intense political strategy within Governor Christie's 2013 reelection campaign \u2013 a none-too-subtle attempt to persuade Democratic political figures across the state to support the governor. Now that strategy figures as a prominent story line in the federal criminal charges against two key Christie allies in the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal.\nThe indictment, released nine days ago, charges that two key Christie allies \u2013 along with a third co-conspirator who has agreed to testify against them \u2013 wanted to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, for his refusal to endorse Christie's Republican campaign.\nGWB scandal archive:\u00a0 Click here to read all of The Record's past coverage\nThis alleged punishment turned out to be paralyzing traffic gridlock that suddenly swamped Fort Lee for parts of five days in September 2013 \u2013 including the first day of school \u2013 when two of three access lanes from the borough's already crowded local streets to the George Washington Bridge were shut down without warning.\nWhat made him so important?\nThat story has been told over and over \u2013 and even joked about. But one question remains unresolved: Why did the Christie campaign seem so desperate to gain the support of Mayor Sokolich anyway? What made him so important to Christie's reelection? So much that he had to be punished?\nSokolich is hardly a Democratic power broker. Before the traffic scandal, he was barely known outside of his town and the largely Democratic wards of eastern Bergen County. What's more, Fort Lee is not exactly a Democratic machine capable of even tilting a countywide election, much less a statewide gubernatorial race.\nRoughly half of the borough's 36,000 residents are registered to vote. And only 41 percent are Democrats. Almost half list themselves as unaffiliated with any political party.\nIn 2009, in winning the governor's race, Christie lost Fort Lee by about 1,800 votes to the unpopular Democratic incumbent, Jon Corzine. But only about 8,000 Fort Lee voters \u2013 about 44 percent \u2013 bothered to go to the polls.\nSmall player in elections\nThe point here is that Fort Lee was not exactly voter-rich territory where a party's ward leader could order large blocks of voters to support one candidate or another \u2013 and thus affect a statewide election. So why would Christie's campaign staff four years later focus so much attention on obtaining an endorsement by the borough's mayor?\nThe overall strategy by the Christie reelection campaign was not only to win across the state by a wide margin in 2013 over the hapless Democratic challenger, Barbara Buono, but to demonstrate that Christie could attract plenty of bipartisan support. The idea here was not to prove anything significant to New Jersey's Republican leaders. They already knew Christie was a powerful candidate. The goal was to show the national Republican Party that Christie could attract a wide array of support, including Democrats. And if he could do this in a Democratic-leaning state like New Jersey, imagine what he could do if he ran for president.\nThat's an expansive strategy. And by Election Day, thanks to the efforts of Christie's campaign staff and their spreadsheets and after-work phone calls, 60 Democratic figures across New Jersey had publicly endorsed Christie for governor.\nIt wasn't a huge number of Democrats. But it was hardly small either.\nThis brings us back to the mystery of the courtship of Mark Sokolich. The federal indictments of the two Christie allies, William Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority, and Bridget Anne Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff for the governor \u2013 as well as the plea agreement to testify against them from their alleged co-conspirator, Port Authority official David Wildstein \u2014 do not shed any light on why Sokolich was targeted for an endorsement and then punished for not coming through.\nSeeking endorsements\nThe indictment merely charges that Kelly (who is not related to this columnist) \"sought\" endorsements from Democratic officials and that several weeks before the traffic gridlock she conspired with Baroni and Wildstein to \"punish Mayor Sokolich by deliberately causing significant traffic problems in Fort Lee through a reduction in the number of the local access lanes \u2014 all under the false pretense of a traffic study.\"\nIt's worth noting that Kelly and Baroni emphatically deny that they concocted any such plan to punish Sokolich. The indictment claims, however, that Kelly sent the now-famous \"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" email to Wildstein after allegedly confirming in mid-August 2013 that Sokolich turned down several overtures from Christie's campaign to endorse the governor.\nIf that scenario is true \u2013 and Kelly's lawyer says they intend to prove it's not \u2013 it still leaves open the question of why Sokolich was so important anyway. And why carry out such a harsh retribution by causing massive traffic jams?\nPunishment worsens\nAs traffic problems worsened in Fort Lee during those five gridlocked days in September 2013, so did the alleged punishment.\nAccording to the indictment, Baroni, Kelly and Wildstein reportedly agreed not to respond to Sokolich's calls for help to the Port Authority and to the governor's office. And in what turned out to be one of the more bizarre twists of the story, Wildstein derided Sokolich in an email as \"this little Serbian.\" In case anyone wonders, Sokolich is hardly little. Nor is he Serbian. He's 6-foot-3 and his ancestors come from Croatia.\nAgain, all this raises the question: Why all the fuss over poor Mark Sokolich?\nSokolich says he has no idea. He quips that he figured he would spend time \"dedicating Little League fields\" as the borough's mayor, not wondering why he is the target of an alleged political feud that seems to defy logic or even common sense.\nAdding to the mystery, he also claimed in an interview last year with this columnist that he was never asked point blank to endorse Christie, only that one of the governor's aides gently inquired on several occasions whether \"this was something\" he \"might consider.\" And perhaps just as significant, Sokolich said he was never threatened with retribution if he declined to endorse Christie.\nFinally, there is this: Christie ended up winning Fort Lee anyway. His margin was hardly a landslide \u2013 only about 800 votes.\nBut it was a victory nonetheless.\nTags:\n"]]

The effect could be devastating for the regional economy as well as for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which relies upon the bridge to generate a large share of its income. The agency projects operating income at the bridge this year of $633 million \u2014\u00a0more than 20 percent of its $3.1 billion operating budget.\nThe private security guards, who work for Summit Security Services, help to guard\u00a0the bridge not only from terrorist attacks, but also work to prevent suicides. Summit also has guards at the PATH rail system that links North Jersey with New York City, the Bayonne and Goethals bridges, the Holland Tunnel and several Port Authority office buildings. They number about 400 across all the Port Authority facilities.\nEight current and former guards at the bridge\u00a0\u2014\u00a0six men and two women \u2014\u00a0spoke to The Record on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from Summit and, in some cases, from their own union. Some had worked in security all their lives. At least half worked at the bridge for more than five years. Several said that simply complaining to a supervisor is enough to provoke retaliation.\n\u201cYou complain and you lose your job,\u201d said one current guard.\nAmong their concerns:\nSecurity vehicles are poorly maintained and some equipment is faulty. Hand-held radios, for example, are sometimes held together with tape.\nUnlike police officers, who patrol in pairs, the guards said they are on their own, often patrolling unlit, secluded areas armed only with a radio to call for help.\nObjects, including people jumping from the bridge, sometimes fall near their guard booths or where they patrol.\nThe 30-square-foot security booths (about 5-by-6-feet) often lack proper heating in the winter or cooling in the summer.\nJohn Cohen, a former counter terrorism coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security, said that\u00a0having highly-trained police officers and well-equipped\u00a0security personnel at sites\u00a0is \u201ccritically important.\u201d\n\u201cThe value that comes from employing additional police officers and security personnel is in part influenced by how well they are trained, how qualified they are to be in those positions, how well they are equipped \u2014\u00a0and all that plays a role in ensuring that they are a productive part of the security apparatus used to protect locations like the George Washington Bridge.\u201d\nWorking conditions can hamper the ability of anyone - whether uniformed officer or security guard - tasked with protecting the public.\n\"It seems to me to be self-evident that if people's work conditions are horrible and degrading they tend not to be very good at the function they are assigned,\" said\u00a0Daniel Benjamin, a former State Department terrorism coordinator who hasn't assessed the situation at the bridge, but\u00a0spoke in general terms about the importance of keeping security personnel focused on their duties.\nThe guards earn between $32,000 and $35,000. Port Authority Police officers, by contrast, are among the highest paid in the region, with officers typically earning $108,000 after six years of service, in addition to generous benefits and a pension.\nStill, the unarmed guards are considered a critical part of security for the agency, said John Bilich, the agency\u2019s deputy chief security officer. While the higher-paid and better-trained police officers perform more demanding work, Bilich said the guards\u2019 principal role is to \u201cobserve and report.\u201d\nMaki Haberfeld, a professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said that because of a lack of resources, agencies often cut costs, particularly at infrastructure assets.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see them looking for the best equipped and the best trained security guards,\u201d Haberfeld said.\nHaberfeld, who trains New York Police Department officers in counterterrorism, said that the Port Authority puts most of its security resources into its airports, bus terminals and the PATH rail system.\nThat makes sense because these areas are highly trafficked by pedestrians and are perceived as softer targets than a bridge, which can be difficult to monitor as well as to escape from should a terrorist wish to do so. But, Haberfeld said, the very fact that the bridge does not receive the same amount of attention, makes it more vulnerable.\n\u201cI can assure you, if tomorrow there is an attack on a major bridge in London, you are going to see a major deployment on the George Washington Bridge,\u201d Haberfeld said. \u201cWe always react to the last war.\u201d\nIndeed, after Friday's attack in Ft. Lauderdale, security was increased at Port Authority airports, officials said.\nA security booth, at the bottom left of photo, sits at the foot of the George Washington Bridge on the New York side. Photographed in Fort Washington Park on Wednesday, December 14, 2016.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\nThe Port Authority\u2019s director of security operations, Mike DeGidio, said the agency has a vested interest in making sure guards are happy because it ensures that they perform their duties well. But DeGidio said the agency is unaware of any concerns about work conditions at the bridge.\nHe said that Summit meets frequently with Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union to talk about guards\u2019 work conditions.\n\u201cWe have not gotten any complaints or concerns about their safety,\u201d DeGidio said.\nThe guards told a different story.\nIn addition to fears of falling bodies and a lack of proper access to bathrooms, guards said that their vehicles were often in a state of poor repair. They cited dirty cars that would shut down without warning, vehicles driven with warning lights illuminated, and one vehicle in which the rubber top\u00a0on the brake pedal was missing making it easy for a person's foot to slip off the brake.\n\"I've never seen a company that is so reckless,\" said one veteran guard referring to Summit, a Long Island-based firm with revenues of $147 million in 2015, which calls itself\u00a0one of the largest privately held security contractors in the country. According to Summit's website, the firm provides security and investigative\u00a0services to hundreds of companies and government agencies across the country, including armed guard services\u00a0for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and fraud investigations for state and city governments.\nAnother veteran guard, who was put in touch with The Record by his union to provide a counterpoint to the criticisms, did not deny the work environment at the bridge was difficult. But he said that his colleagues should stop complaining.\n\"I am a person who likes a challenge,\" he said.\nSecurity Challenge\nSince 9/11, the Port Authority has spent more than $1 billion shoring up its defenses. Annually, security accounts for almost one-quarter of the agency\u2019s operating budget. This year, security costs are expected to reach $707 million.\nThe agency employs 1,800 police officers who are supported by an additional 1,000 unarmed guards.\nAs terrorism shifts\u00a0towards a rise in attacks by people acting independently of terrorist organizations, private guards are becoming an increasingly important part of security.\n\u201cParts of our critical infrastructure, including seaports, airports and even bridges that have a high concentration of motor vehicle traffic\u00a0are all potential targets in this new age we find ourselves in,\u201d Cohen said.\nCohen, now a professor at Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, said traditional counterterrorism capabilities are not designed to detect this new brand of terrorist. So the role of police officers and private security guards becomes even more important.\nCohen said a highly visible security presence, including unarmed officers, can deter attackers conducting surveillance.\nBut the use of private contractors is not always successful.\nSummit\u2019s predecessors, FJC Security, lost a similar contract following several security slips, including employing an illegal immigrant\u00a0who had assumed a murdered man\u2019s identity, as a Newark airport supervisor, and allowing three parachutists to jump from the top of 1 World Trade Center.\nThis video was filmed by parachutists who jumped from 1 World Trade Center. The Record does not endorse and is not affiliated with nycbasejump.\nJust two months after Summit took over the contract, in May 2014, a thrill-seeking teenager from Weehawken got past several Summit guards and climbed to the top of 1 World Trade Center. In response, the Port Authority gave the trade center contract to another security firm and reduced Summit\u2019s contract by $37 million.\nAlthough private guards have had their share of lapses \u2014\u00a0two guards at the George Washington Bridge were fired in 2009 after being caught sleeping on the job \u2014\u00a0the Port Authority Police Department is not immune from criticism.\nLast month, the Port Authority filed disciplinary charges against one-third of the PATH rail system\u2019s police force \u2014 44 officers \u2014 who were accused of taking hours-long breaks when they were supposed to be patrolling stations.\nDaniel Sepulveda, Summit\u2019s vice president of security, declined to answer questions regarding when Summit began its work with the Port Authority, how many employees work for the agency or at the George Washington Bridge, or when the most recent contract was signed, citing \u201csafety and security\u201d reasons.\nRegarding working conditions cited by the guards, including concerns over falling objects and lack of bathroom access, Sepulveda said:\n\u201cThree years ago we were contacted by\u00a0[the Occupational Safety and Health Administration] because a claim was submitted at the GWB site. Summit cooperated fully with the investigation of the allegations, and the fine was substantially reduced. None of the conditions you refer to existed,\u00a0then or now.\u201d\nSepulveda also suggested that guards with complaints consult their collective bargaining agreement for answers.\nGuards, who pay about $60 a month in union dues, say that Local 32BJ has failed to protect them from harassment, deal with grievances quickly or take their complaints seriously. They say that it took the union about two years to resolve an issue over unpaid vacation from 2014.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the Boston Tea Party,\u201d said one guard. \u201cYou are being taxed, but you have no representation.\u201d\nA security booth at the base to the right of the George Washington Bridge in New York.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\nOf the 48 guards who have worked the site over the last three years, 10 have been fired, according to a spokeswoman for Local 32BJ, who called the rate \u201cslightly above average.\u201d\nSix guards were reinstated after the union intervened.\nOne guard filed a charge against Local 32BJ with the National Labor Relations Board in December 2015, alleging that the union breached its duty of fair representation by failing to process grievances related to unused vacation pay, vehicle safety, harassment and overtime.\nThe NLRB dismissed the complaint in March 2016, finding that the union had taken some actions related to the complaints and that the guard failed to provide evidence that the union \u201cacted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\u201d\nUnion official Kevin Brown, who helped unionize the guards about 10 years ago, denied many of the allegations, emphasizing that guards do not complain about pay and benefits because the union has helped them achieve better levels of both. The guards earn $17 an hour.\nBrown added that before the guards unionized there were no relief guards provided for bathroom breaks.\n\u201cWorkers had to [urinate] into a paper bag in the booth,\u201d Brown said. (A guard said Brown was only half right. He said that guards used paper bags for solid waste.)\n\u201cThe bottom line is this is still a good job and it wouldn\u2019t be a good job if it wasn\u2019t for all the things we\u2019ve done there,\u201d Brown said.\nThe union directed The Record to speak to a current guard at the bridge, who said some of his colleagues \u201cexaggerate a lot of things.\u201d\nThe guard, a longtime employee who did not wish to be identified because he, too, feared retaliation from Summit, said that people jumping off the bridge and landing in the parks is rare, happening only once a year at most.\n\u201cThe problem is,\u201d the guard added, \u201csome people, they complain for everything.\u201d\nOne female guard who spoke to The Record said she was sick of complaining.\nWhen she was regularly posted in a desolate spot during the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift, she often called a Port Authority supervisor to report groups of men congregating in the park, which was supposed to be closed overnight.\nSometimes the supervisor would send out a Port Authority police patrol to check it out. But mostly, she said, she was left on her own.\nShe soon learned that when she saw a group of men overnight, the only thing to do was to lock herself in her booth and wait for them to leave. Sometimes, she waited hours before she could resume her patrols.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d the security guard said.\nA security booth on the Hudson River at the foot of the George Washington Bridge on the New York side.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\n190 CONNECT TWEET 9 LINKEDIN 21 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jecZML\n"]]

That\u2019s when \u00a0the state\u00a0will embark on a completely new way of dealing with people\u00a0charged with crimes, allowing the vast majority to remain free without having to pay\u00a0bail.\nAt the same time, new \u201cspeedy trial\u201d rules will take effect\u00a0with the goal of making\u00a0sure that prisoners who are kept in jail\u00a0don\u2019t languish there\u00a0for longer than six months before they're tried.\nIn 2014,\u00a0voters approved a change in\u00a0the state constitution to allow judges to deny\u00a0bail to\u00a0the most dangerous\u00a0defendants,\u00a0which means they will not be\u00a0released before\u00a0trial.\u00a0Previously, only those charged with crimes that could carry\u00a0death sentences\u00a0could be held in jail. The death penalty\u00a0was abolished in New Jersey in 2007.\nUnder the new rules, defendants who are charged with murder or a\u00a0crime punishable by life imprisonment are still held in jail. But the rules also give defendants the right to argue against\u00a0detention\u00a0if they can prove\u00a0that detention is not justified.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people waiting in jail for trial for minor offenses for over a year because they can\u2019t raise $2,500 bail,\u201d said one judge who asked to remain anonymous because of rules against speaking publicly,\u00a0\u201cand at the same time, we have defendants accused of serious crimes who have no trouble making even very high bail, and they are released.\u201d\nBudget impacts\nThe requirement for speedy trials will have a significant financial impact because\u00a0counties will have to pay for more prosecutors and sheriff\u2019s officers so that\u00a0legal proceedings can move more quickly. In Passaic County alone, according to one judge, two more judges and six more\u00a0sheriff\u2019s officers\u00a0will\u00a0have to be hired.\nREACTIONS: Read responses to bail reform\nIn addition, there will be a need to more quickly prepare pretrial risk assessments needed by judges to determine whom to release and whom to detain. And more pretrial services officers will have\u00a0to keep track of defendants who are\u00a0released while awaiting trial.\nJohn\u00a0Donnadio, the executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, which represents New Jersey\u2019s 21 county governments,\u00a0said it will take an estimated $45 million in\u00a0startup costs\u00a0for\u00a0counties\u00a0to comply\u00a0with the new rules.\n\u201cThere are some significant upfront costs we\u2019re looking at,\u201d\u00a0Donnadio\u00a0said. \u00a0\"The counties will need to hire new staff and pay for videoconferencing technology for the additional hearings. Additionally, they must shoulder the costs of keeping courthouses open on the weekends.\"\n\u201cWe support the concept of bail reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re just looking for relief from the Legislature, whether from an appropriation or delaying the policy for a year so we can get a better handle on what the costs are.\u201d\nBut Ed Barocas, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, disagreed that the state was required to provide funding.\u00a0\"There is\u00a0a constitutional requirement for a speedy trial, and you can't avoid that by saying there's no funding,\" he said.\nBarocas also took issue with the failure of the new law to cover defendants who were charged before Jan. 1 and are already in jail awaiting trial.\n\"They have a constitutional right to a speedy trial as well, and they should be treated no differently than new defendants,\" he said. Barocas said the ACLU would work with public defenders to make certain that previously detained defendants are not left behind as new defendants move ahead of them because of the law.\nIn Passaic County, records show, 669 defendants were awaiting trial for more than a year as of October, though it was not immediately clear how many of them were in jail and how many were free.\nAlthough\u00a0it might look\u00a0on the face of it\u00a0as though counties might actually save money with fewer inmates to care for as they await trials, legal experts point out that initial savings will not be great because it will not be immediately possible to thin the ranks of corrections officers who staff the jails. \"There could be some savings on meals, but that's not significant,\" one judge said.\nInstead of bail, judges will make decisions on who gets freedom and who gets jail based on a three-part risk assessment\u00a0aimed at calculating the risk of flight, the risk of danger to the community and the risk that the accused will try\u00a0to interfere with justice by threatening witnesses or victims.\nEconomic implications\nThe new system is expected to hit the bail bond business especially hard, and people in that business have been lobbying hard against it.\nBail bondsman Kirk Shaw of Hackensack.\n\u00a0(Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com)\nKirk Shaw, who runs a bail bond business in Hackensack, said the new law would \u201ctake away 99 percent of the bail bond business.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not real risk assessment,\u201d Shaw added. \u201cThis is just wholesale release. They just want to do this no matter what.\u201d\nRichard Blender, a Paterson lawyer who has represented criminal defendants and bail bondsmen in 40 years of legal practice, said the new law was the result of a misguided assumption that the only reason a lot\u00a0of people are in jail before trial is because\u00a0they cannot afford bail.\nBlender proposed what he called a \"simple solution: just let those defendants out without bail. But the vast majority of defendants arrested in the state, for violent and serious offenses, many with prior criminal records, should have to post some sort of bail.\"\nInitially, assignment judges expect the new system\u00a0to put a strain on the judicial system. Statewide, it is anticipated that about 20 more judges will have to be appointed to take on the extra load. In addition to that, each newly appointed judge will have to have office space and a support staff, including a legal secretary and a law clerk, and will require a minimum of three county sheriff's officers to ensure\u00a0order in the courtroom.\nAdditionally, according to one judge, courts will have to be in operation on weekends\u00a0to meet the demands of the new rules that risk assessments and criminal complaints be filed within 48 hours after a defendant is first detained in a county jail.\nRelease criteria\nBut judges have been given an extensive list of procedures aimed at making sure they can properly assess the\u00a0risk of releasing\u00a0defendants while they await\u00a0trial.\nThe rules require a pretrial services program to make an assessment, considering\u00a0an arrested defendant\u2019s age, whether the offense\u00a0was violent, whether there have been prior convictions or pending charges,\u00a0whether there have been prior prison sentences and whether the defendant has failed\u00a0to make\u00a0court appearances.\nIf a defendant is released, under some circumstances it will be without conditions, according to the steps outlined in an 84-page directive from the state\u00a0Attorney\u00a0General\u2019s\u00a0Office.\nEven if detention might be\u00a0justified, there are several conditions that can be imposed to allow the defendant to avoid having to await trial behind bars. In less serious cases, the conditions could be as\u00a0simple\u00a0as once-a-month phone contact with a probation officer. In cases where the weight of the factors in the pretrial assessment add up against the defendant, the conditions could range from more frequent phone contact to face-to-face contact\u00a0to electronic monitoring to home detention.\nIn some cases, a judge can decide that the only way to ensure a defendant appears\u00a0in court is to require that\u00a0bail be paid, but those cases are expected to be few and far between, according to judges who asked that that their names be withheld because they are not permitted to speak publicly.\nA judge is not allowed to consider\u00a0race, gender, income, education, home address, history of drug use, family status, marital status, national origin, employment or religion in deciding whether to release a defendant before trial.\nThe\u00a0concept of judging such factors as previous prison sentences, offenses\u00a0and danger to the community, known as a PSA,\u00a0was developed by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, a Texas-based research organization that studies issues raised by the criminal justice system.\u00a0\u00a0To create the assessment tool, the Arnold Foundation used a database of more than 1.5 million cases drawn from more than 300\u00a0jurisdictions across the country. According to the foundation, the standard is\u00a0being used in 29 jurisdictions, including three\u00a0states: Arizona, Kentucky, and \u2014\u00a0as of Jan. 1 \u2014\u00a0New Jersey.\nAnd if a defendant who is released while awaiting trial violates a condition of release or a restraining order, the judge can either make the conditions of release more stringent or \u2014\u00a0if the judge finds \"clear and convincing evidence\" that no condition of release would ensure the\u00a0defendant's appearance in court, \u00a0protect\u00a0the community\u00a0or that the defendant will attempt to obstruct the criminal justice system\u00a0\u2014 the judge can\u00a0order the defendant\u00a0await trial in jail.\nEmail: norman@northjersey.com\nBail reform and speedy trial: How they work\nNew bail reform and speedy trial rules effective: Jan 1.\nFirst appearance: For a summons (minor violation), within 60 days after arrest. For a warrant (criminal complaint), within 48 hours after arrest and commitment to county jail.\nExcept in unusual cases where nothing else will ensure\u00a0appearance in court, bail is a thing of the past.\nA defendant charged on a summons is released without bail. If the defendant is later arrested for failure\u00a0to appear, the judge must decide within 12 hours whether to release without any conditions\u00a0or release with bail. If the defendant can't post bail, a bail reduction hearing must be heard on an expedited basis.\nA defendant charged on a warrant: \u00a0Risk assessment forwarded to a judge, and the judge decides within 48 hours of arrest whether to release defendant or detain the defendant in jail to await trial.\nIf a criminal defendant is released, conditions can range from being freed on recognizance to being subject to varying levels of monitoring (weekly or monthly phone contact or face-to-face contact with probation officer, electronic monitoring, home detention).\nCriminal defendants are sent to county jail to await trial (with no possibility of bail) \u00a0in cases of:\nFirst or second degree No Early Release Act violations, like murder;\nCrimes punishable by life imprisonment;\nAny crime if defendant has been convicted before under either of the above;\nAny Megan's Law crime or human trafficking of a minor,\u00a0or a crime involving domestic violence;\nAny crime where there is a serious risk the defendant will not appear in court, will pose a danger to another person or will attempt to obstruct justice or threaten, injure or intimidate a witness or a juror.\nSpeedy trial rules apply only to defendants who are in jail awaiting trial. Time limits are: 90 days from detention to indictment; 180 days from indictment to start of trial. Extensions are possible, with an overall time limit of two years. Delays caused by defendants or their attorneys do not count toward the limits. If limits are reached, defendant is released to await trial, either on his own\u00a0recognizance or with conditions.\nNeither speedy trial rules nor bail reform rules apply to defendants who\u00a0were arrested before Jan. 1, 2017, and are awaiting trial\u00a0in county jail because they have not been able to make bail (but this may be subject to subsequent court challenge on constitutional grounds).\n573 CONNECT TWEET 36 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2hvLcZP\n"]]

Why weren\u2019t they charged too? Are they still working in government? And when, if ever, will their names be known?\nLegal experts say that, if the case goes to trial, there\u2019s a good chance prosecutors will have to reveal the identities of those \u201cunindicted co-conspirators,\u201d whom U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman has confirmed exist. And depending on who is on the list, the revelations could carry further political consequences for the Christie administration far beyond the courtroom.\nAn in-depth look at the scandal over the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge and related aftershocks. Click here to launch .\nMarko Georgiev /staff photographer\nU.S. Attorney Paul Fishmanbut wouldn't say who.\nThey could also play into the defense strategy of Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director at the Port Authority, and Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, both of whom have pleaded not guilty to charges that they purposely caused traffic jams in Fort Lee in September 2013 to get back at the borough\u2019s mayor for not endorsing Christie. Another former Port Authority official, David Wildstein, has pleaded guilty.\nKelly said in her first public remarks that it would be \u201cludicrous\u201d to believe she was the only one in the governor\u2019s office who knew about the lane closings, suggesting she is being singled out. And Baroni\u2019s attorneys said they want to know who else the government believes is involved but decided not to charge.\nGWB scandal archive:\u00a0 Click here to read all of The Record's past coverage\n\u201cThe government will not prosecute Mr. Baroni in a vacuum,\u201d attorneys Michael Baldassare and Jennifer Mara said in a statement Thursday. Baroni \u201cwill use every means available to discover who the prosecution thinks was involved,\u201d the lawyers wrote, adding that their client is innocent.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the term \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d has added intrigue to a political scandal. The term is used to describe someone whom prosecutors have \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe was part of a conspiracy but whom they declined to charge.\nPresident Richard Nixon was tagged with that label in the Watergate investigation when seven administration officials were indicted by a grand jury in 1974. Prosecutors investigating the Whitewater controversy in Arkansas in the mid-1990s described a White House deputy counsel under President Bill Clinton that way.\nIn the indictment unsealed on May 1, Fishman offered few clues about the statement that \u201cothers\u201d beyond those charged were involved in the scheme.\nTwo separate inquiries into the closures \u2014 one by the Democratic-led state Legislature and another commissioned by Christie, a Republican \u2014 have generated any number of candidates. In the wake of the lane closures, several people in the administration and at the Port Authority, which controls the bridge, repeated what prosecutors now say was a \u201csham\u201d cover story: that the lane closures were part of a traffic study. The question is whether prosecutors have evidence that any of those people were aware of the sinister motivations that were allegedly behind the closings.\nAn attorney for Wildstein, who has agreed to be a witness, has said multiple times that \u201cevidence exists\u201d the governor was aware of the lane closures while they were in place. Christie has denied that and said he did not authorize the closures and was not involved in the planning or execution of them.\nWhen he pleaded guilty in federal court on May 1, Wildstein told a judge under oath that \u201cothers, including Baroni and Kelly,\u201d were involved in planning the lane closures in the month before they were put into effect.\nLater that day at a press conference announcing the indictments, Fishman declined to elaborate on who or how many others there were.\n\u201cThe indictment does say Bridget Kelly, Bill Baroni, David Wildstein and others,\u201d Fishman told reporters. \u201cWe don\u2019t identify unindicted co-conspirators in our indictment by name unless they have been previously mentioned in a publicly filed court document, and that is not the case here.\u201d\nReasons not to indict\nThere are a number of possible reasons prosecutors could decide to identify people as co-conspirators but not indict them.\n\u201cIt could be that they are a cooperating witness, it could be someone they don\u2019t have quite enough evidence on, or it could be someone they want to send a message to, that \u2018You might be next,\u2019\u0178\u201d said Michael Koenig, a former federal prosecutor specializing in white-collar crime for the Department of Justice and now a partner at the Albany, N.Y., law firm Hinckley Allen.\nDuring his press conference, Fishman stressed that he would only seek to indict someone he felt confident would be convicted at trial. And he acknowledged that the \u201cothers\u201d may be identified at a later stage in the case. A spokesman for Fishman said last week that prosecutors would reveal the \u201cunindicted co-conspirators\u201d if the judge overseeing the case issued an order to do so after a formal request by defense attorneys.\nThe identities of \u201cunindicted co-conspirators\u201d are typically shielded in the early stages of a criminal case, legal experts say. Department of Justice guidelines state that \u201cfederal prosecutors generally should not identify unindicted co-conspirators in conspiracy indictments.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s universally considered unethical to name someone in an indictment who you aren\u2019t indicting, because you are smearing someone without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves,\u201d said Solomon L. Wisenberg, a partner in charge of the white-collar practice at the Washington, D.C., firm Nelson Mullins.\nIt wasn\u2019t always so. Prominent New Jersey defense attorney Joseph A. Hayden Jr. said that when he started practicing law in the early 1970s, it was customary for prosecutors to name names even if they weren\u2019t charged.\n\u201cHowever, that was very unfair to the named unindicted co-conspirator, who at times could never vindicate their name. So the courts have changed that,\u201d he said.\nThe shift occurred after a 1975 federal appellate court criticized a grand jury indictment that charged seven people \u2014 but also identified by name three others as unindicted co-conspirators\u00a0\u2014 in connection with political demonstrations at the Republican National Convention in Miami in 1972. The seven defendants were acquitted at trial. The appeals court later ordered the names of the three others removed from the indictment.\n\u201cHow would you or how would I or how would any around this room like to have the grand jury come in and name us as a co-conspirator and yet not indict us and give us no chance to be heard,\u201d the appellate judge asked rhetorically in the published opinion.\nSome indictments do include details that make it possible to identify the unindicted co-conspirators. \u201cBut the general rule would be to leave out that detail unless it was a necessary component of the charges against the individual,\u201d said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at the firm McCarter & English in Newark.\nIf the case goes to trial, however, the information is typically turned over to those charged so they can defend themselves.\nDefense requests\nDefense attorneys typically make a formal request for the information in the lead-up to a trial. Some experts said they could see little reason in this case why a judge would not agree that the information should be turned over.\n\u201cThere are cases where witnesses and unindicted co-conspirators should be kept secret until the last moment, such as organized crime or gang cases,\u201d when individuals\u2019 safety may be at risk if they are exposed, said Koenig, the former federal prosecutor. \u201cGenerally, defendants should not have to guess or speculate what the evidence is or who the witnesses against them are, or who the unindicted co-conspirators are.\u201d\nWhether defense attorneys would make that public depends on if it fits into their strategy. The possibility of a wider conspiracy could help the defense, some said.\n\u201cWe may see defense lawyers trying to suggest that others may have been involved, either with or without their clients, in order to ultimately argue to jurors that prosecutors either charged the wrong people or in the alternative have unfairly singled out their clients for criminal conduct that involved a wider circle of co-conspirators,\u201d Mintz said.\nProsecutors may also have an interest in identifying unindicted co-conspirators at trial if they want to include as evidence statements any of those people made that establishes there was a conspiracy. Statements made outside the courtroom by people not involved in the conspiracy would be excluded as hearsay in a trial, Hayden said. But they would be admissible as evidence if prosecutors establish that the person who made the comments was an unindicted co-conspirator, he said.\nAnd in the event that revealing the unindicted co-conspirators does not figure into the strategy of either the prosecution or the defense?\n\u201cIt\u2019s more likely than not that it would never come out,\u201d Hayden said.\nEmail: boburg@northjersey.com\u00a0\n"]]

However, in the nearly three years he's been mayor, none of his efforts to ban or reduce the number of horses has been successful. The horses' owners in turn say the animals are happy and well-tended and that they are carrying on an iconic New York tradition \u2013 even in the face of regular protests.\nHORSE RIDING RING:\u00a0Rockleigh Equestrian Centre appeals board's denial\nCarriage horses have traversed the city's streets since the 1880s, and grew in popularity as a tourist attraction after World War II. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was an avid supporter of the industry.\n\"The horses here are supervised by the health department, the ASPCA,\" Bloomberg said in 2011. \u201cThey\u2019re well taken care of. And most of them wouldn\u2019t be alive if they didn\u2019t have a job.\u201d\nCarriage horses have been at work in the city since the 1880s.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Staff Photographer)\nFor de Blasio, the pledge to ban the horses looks increasingly quixotic.\n\"You can't just ban a legal business that isn't doing anything wrong,\" said carriage horse driver Christina Hansen.\nDe Blasio\u2019s attempt at compromise \u2013 to reduce the number of horses and house them in a Central Park stable, rather than at their four stables in Hell's Kitchen \u2013 was shot down by the City Council, which canceled a vote on it in February. His office did not respond to a request to comment.\nFor many of the activists, there can be no compromise. Last weekend, several dozen protesters with the group Empty the Carriages urged tourists not to ride the carriages and shouted for de Blasio to \"Keep your promise!\"\nActivist Edita Birnkrant called the carriage horses' presence in midtown traffic a \"recipe for disaster.\"\n\"We cannot change the industry in any way to make it more humane for horses. We cannot change the fact that New York City is a very chaotic place,\" she said.\nAlong 59th Street, where the horses wait for tourists, angry drivers lay on their car horns, hot dog stands emit acrid smells, and firetrucks blaze past, sirens blaring.\n\"He's obviously so stressed out and spooked by the traffic,\" Hansen said sarcastically\u00a0as her horse, Oreo, quietly nibbled on a carrot.\nBy law, the horses cannot be out of their stables for more than nine hours a day. They are forbidden to travel below 34th Street. They cannot work in temperatures above 89 degrees, lower than 19 degrees\u00a0or in extreme weather. For five weeks a year, they must be on vacation, which they usually spend in Amish country in Pennsylvania, Hansen said.\nA handler gives directions as his horse stands along 59th Street.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Staff Photographer)\nOne hundred ninety-three horses drive 68 licensed carriages. The maximum drivers can charge, as set by the city, is $54 for 20 minutes, not including tip.\u00a0\nThe horses are licensed and subject to inspection by the city's health department, police, the sanitation department and the ASPCA, and are examined twice a year.\nQuinnipiac polls from de Blasio's first year in office showed most New Yorkers opposed his proposed carriage-horse ban. The most recent, from January 2015, showed 63 percent opposed the ban versus 25 percent who supported the plan.\n\"They continue to say neigh to his plan to ban horse-drawn carriages,\" wrote the poll's assistant director, Maurice Carroll, in a press release.\nTourists adore the horses, and said that they assumed the horses were cared for.\n\"Lovely,\" Paddy Ryan of Ireland said. \"Part of the culture of New York City.\"\n\"I think it'd be a nice thing to do,\" said his wife, Breda, of taking a ride.\n\"It was wonderful,\" said Christy Moss of Bismarck, Ill., who had just finished a ride with her husband Eric and their 6-year-old twins, Amelie and Anouk.\u00a0\nBirnkrant rejected the notion that horses should be used for profit or treated \"like machines.\"\n\"I think it's a very backwards, antiquated, medieval way of thinking that literally animals should be our slaves,\" she said. She and other activists with Empty the Carriages plan to protest more this weekend.\nHansen saw the issue differently.\n\"I think that humans are better in partnership with animals,\" she said. She viewed the industry as a group of small family businesses upholding a long-standing city tradition.\n\"People would be upset if we weren't here anymore,\" she said.\nA horse-drawn carriage traveling along 59th Street this week.\n\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Staff Photographer)\n133 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2hstiEK\n"]]

[["name", "new_7/1511.html"], ["url", "http://archive.northjersey.com/opinion/opinion-editorials/politics-of-the-gwb-1.1325542"], ["text", "\u00a9 2017 North Jersey Media Group\nMay 5, 2015\nLast updated: Tuesday, May 5, 2015, 8:02 AM\nThe Record: Politics of the GWB\nThe Record\nFORMER PORT Authority of New York and New Jersey Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni and Governor Christie's former deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly entered not guilty pleas Monday in Newark. Both were named in a nine-count federal indictment Friday in connection with the access-lane closures at the George Washington Bridge during the week of Sept. 9, 2013.\nTheir lawyers promise to disprove David Wildstein's allegations that they were part of a scheme to create a traffic nightmare in Fort Lee as retaliation against the borough's mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who did not endorse Republican Christie's 2013 reelection. While it will be many months before details emerge in a trial, what \u2014 or, more accurately, who \u2014 should literally emerge now is the governor of New Jersey.\nLast Friday, Christie was in Virginia. Today he is scheduled to be in Mississippi and Louisiana. When is Christie going to consistently show up at his day job, the one some people were so focused on his retaining in 2013 that they allegedly broke the law?\nChristie's 2016 presidential hopes are fading \u2014 fast. Whether he can succeed in winning a presidential primary is not a concern of New Jersey residents. But whether he intends to govern the state of New Jersey is a concern.\nThe governor does not appear interested in governing, but he is interested in winning one more election. What is clear from the GWB scandal \u2014 particularly now that Wildstein, another former top Christie appointee at the Port Authority, has admitted the lane closures were politically motivated \u2014 is that politics is all that matters to Christie and to the people closest to him.\nBack in 2013, the business of the state and the business of Christie's reelection were being commingled. Wildstein, Kelly and Baroni are alleged to have used the people of Fort Lee \u2014 including schoolchildren \u2014 as pawns in a political game. The message was: Endorse Christie or face the consequences.\nNow Christie wants New Jerseyans to believe that he knew nothing about what was going on and that he has no responsibility for what occurred. On Friday, Christie tweeted that he was vindicated by the indictments because he was not directly tied to the lane closures. There was no Christie tweet expressing deep sorrow that the people of Fort Lee were thrown into weeklong gridlock because of the actions of people in his office and his appointees at the Port Authority.\nFriday's tweets were all about Christie. The governor's so-called Mastro report, a multimillion-dollar whitewash on the GWB scandal, was all about Christie. Where do the people of New Jersey come in?\nNot through two closed access lanes to the GWB, that's for sure. The arrogance of those actions was remarkable \u2014 Christie and his supporters even questioned why Fort Lee had dedicated lanes to the GWB, as if the local lanes were somehow restricted solely to Fort Lee residents and as if the George Washington Bridge were somehow not connected to Fort Lee but to some other place in New Jersey.\nWhether the lane closures were about political payback has been unclear for more than a year. There are still many unanswered questions about the lane closures: who masterminded the scheme and who facilitated its execution. But what is clear is that the lane closures were about politics.\nChristie talks about leadership; a political action committee supporting his possible presidential candidacy is even called Leadership Matters for America. Leadership matters for New Jersey as well.\nIn our democracy, the art of politics is a means to an end \u2014 it is the process that enables candidates to win public office. In the Christie administration, politics appears to have been the means and the end.\nThat may not violate any federal law, but it is a damning indictment nonetheless.\n"]]

Trump\u2019s administration.\nThe intent is not to characterize whether the actions move a particular issue in a positive or negative direction. Rather, it will chart the results of policies created, modified or discontinued over the next four years and how they affect life in New Jersey.\nThe \"Trump Tracker\" will measure changes and trends on such issues as health care, immigration, transportation, job creation, the military, political influence, energy and the environment, regulations, the Newark seaport, infrastructure, passenger rail, taxes, homeland security and the social safety net.\nWe will update certain topics at least once every three months, offering insights of the new administration, its policies, actions and the trickle-down effects on New Jersey.\n**********\nIf New Jersey had a Facebook page, its relationship status with the White House during the eight years President Barack Obama was president would best be described as \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not likely to change after Donald Trump is inaugurated.\nTrump lost New Jersey to Hillary Clinton by 546,000 votes in November, though how much effort either candidate made to win the state\u2019s 14 electoral votes is debatable since operatives from both parties focused more on neighboring Pennsylvania, which helped decide the national outcome.\nTrump\u2019s loss here showed again that while Gov. Chris\u00a0Christie could win the state twice, his support for other candidates \u2013 he endorsed Trump shortly after his own presidential bid failed \u2013\u00a0did not have much sway with state voters, especially with his own popularity lagging.\nDonald Trump with Gov. Chris Christie at a campaign event in May.\n(Photo: AP Photo/Mel Evans)\nChristie had been serving as Trump\u2019s transition chairman through Election Day, and afterward he was considered a favorite for an influential post , possibly including chief of staff. Instead, Christie was demoted from his transition role, and he did not get any position in the administration.\nSo the state\u2019s overwhelming preference for Clinton over Trump, and the distance the president-elect put between himself and the governor, would indicate the state may be on the outs when it comes to dealing with the administration.\nBut there are mitigating factors, too.\n\u201cDonald Trump certainly knows New Jersey, not only because of his residency in New York but also because of his significant investments in New Jersey,\u201d said Rep. Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon County. \u201cIt may very well be that Camp David North will be in the congressional district I serve, in Bedminster.\u201d\nLance said that if Trump succeeds in getting manufacturing companies to bring back jobs they shipped overseas, the state could benefit. He noted that top White House aides will include New Jersey resident Kellyanne Conway, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign manager, and Bill Stepien, a top political adviser to Christie until the governor fired him over his connection to the Bridgegate lane-closing scandal.\nIn Congress, New Jersey will no longer have someone with a personal relationship with the president like the one Sen. Cory Booker had with Obama. But Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of Harding recently became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a post that will help him influence how spending is doled out.\nRodney Frelinghuysen has served in the House of Representatives for 22 years.\n(Photo: Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com)\nThe relationship between the state and the Trump White House also must be considered in comparison to the one it had with Obama.\nObama won New Jersey easily in both 2008 and 2012 , but the state\u2019s Democratic Party organization overwhelmingly opposed him in the 2008 primary. So while there was agreement with Democrats on many major policies, and Obama consistently scored higher in opinion polls in the state\u00a0than nationally, there was also distance between him and the state\u2019s top Democrats until Booker became a senator in 2013.\nA major exception was the response to Superstorm Sandy in 2012, when the state benefited from the joint efforts of Democratic senators and House members from New Jersey and New York, as well as the influence of Christie and Frelinghuysen, then a senior member of the appropriations committee.\nDemocrats who have served in Congress since 2000, the last time a Republican president succeeded a Democrat, say they are much more concerned this time.\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., testified Wednesday against fellow Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination to be attorney general.\n(Photo: AP FILE PHOTO)\n\u201cMy concern is we're a progressive state and progressive legislation is what helps us,\u201d said Rep. Frank Pallone, a Democrat from Monmouth County. \u201cWe need to have people have health care. We're concerned about the environment. And so far every pronouncement he's made about health and environmental issues has been very negative.\u201d\nAt the same time, Pallone said the incoming administration has left many details vague.\n\u201cI always start with the assumption that whoever's president is someone we can appeal to and basically make our case why he should help the state, so I don't start from the premise that we can't appeal to Trump about New Jersey issues,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cWe don't know exactly what Trump's going to do on any issue.\u201d\nMore Topics\n"]]

Trump\u2019s administration.\u00a0\nThe intent is not to characterize whether the actions move a particular issue in a positive or negative direction. Rather, it will chart the results of policies created, modified or discontinued over the next four years and how they affect life in New Jersey.\nThe Trump Tracker will measure changes and trends on such issues as healthcare, immigration, transportation, job creation, the military, political influence, energy and the environment, regulations, the Newark seaport, infrastructure, passenger rail, taxes, homeland security and the social safety net.\nWe will update certain topics at least once every three months, offering insights of the new administration, its policies, actions and the trickle-down effects on New Jersey.\nTransportation Security Administration\nNeeded changes already implemented\nDonald Trump has pledged to end long wait times at airports like Newark Liberty International, though some of the underlying problems are already being addressed.\nTravelers at Newark Liberty regularly saw long waits early last year, to the point that lawmakers and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voiced concern. Some travelers waited more than an hour, due in large part to a shortage of trained staff.\nThe Port Authority in May criticized the Transportation Security Administration, which operates the airport security screening process\u00a0and urged it to take steps to shorten the wait.\n\"Given the adverse customer service and economic impacts, we can no longer tolerate the continuing inadequacy of TSA passenger screening services,\" Chief Security Officer Thomas Belfiore and Aviation Director Thomas Bosco wrote.\nLater that month, Sens. Cory Booker and Robert Menendez announced that the Newark was in the process of hiring nearly a hundred new screeners and deploying bomb-sniffing dogs to speed up the process.\n\"The outrageously long wait times we have witnessed in Newark not only slow down travel, but they also slow down economic growth for New Jersey and the region,\" Booker said.\nThe TSA also created a command center in Washington, D.C., which monitors security screenings at seven airports including Newark.\nAnd while wait times fluctuated over the holiday season, customer outrage seemed to have quieted down.\nOne of Trump's campaign promises is to reform the TSA, and he said on the trail that he would consider replacing current employees with veterans. He also seemed to consider the removal of hijab-wearing Muslim TSA agents, in apparent violation of protected religious freedoms\n\"We're looking at that,\" he said in response to the suggestion. \"We're looking at a lot of things.\"\nHomeland Security Funding\nNew Jersey infrastructure among top targets\nNew Jersey also relies on millions of dollars of federal Homeland Security funding, though it's unclear how a Trump presidency might affect these programs.\nTrump has promised both to increase the size of the U.S. military and eliminate wasteful spending, including \"ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs,\" according to his campaign website.\nNew Jersey currently receives about $32 million in Homeland Security funding through three federal grant programs. The Homeland Security grant program, with $8.4 million in funding, helps the state and urban areas prevent and respond to threats of terrorism. The Urban Areas Security Initiative, with $20.1 million in funding, provides training for terrorism prevention and response in high-threat, densely populated areas.\nThe Nonprofit Security Grant Program, with $4.3 million in funding, equips qualifying nonprofits with security equipment for their properties.\nFederal funding for these programs has declined in recent years, down from $61 million in 2010.\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers including Booker and Menendez has urged more funding through the Urban Areas Security Initiative to help protect the state from cyberattacks.\n\"The amount of critical infrastructure in New Jersey that must be protected creates a dense digital attack surface,\" the letter reads.\nTrump might look more favorably on this approach to funding. Cybersecurity was a major issue during the campaign, and he pledged to bolster U.S. cyber defenses.\n\"We have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare,\" Trump said in September. \"It is a huge problem.\"\nMore Topics\n"]]

Some experts said this was an important safety provision, given  high suicide and homelessness rates among transgender children whose families didn\u2019t support them.\nTransgender policy\nHow North Jersey\u2019s high school districts address the needs and privacy of transgender students:\nSpecific policy\nNon-specific policy\nNo policy\nThe fear of rejection often is so strong among transgender students that even those who are close to their parents said they were anxious when they came out.\nGio Leotsakas, 16, of Wayne said he wrote a letter to his mother to tell her he was not her daughter but her son, and was so nervous after reading about transgender children being thrown out of their homes that he packed a bag as a precaution. Another transgender boy, Jonah Elgamal, 15, whose family is Muslim and who lived until recently in West Milford, said he was \u201cfreaking out\u201d when he came out as transgender because he could not imagine going through the pain of hiding his real self any longer.\n\u25baGrowing up transgender: North Jersey kids tell of unease, bullying, acceptance\nIn both cases, the boys said they had been embraced not only by family but also by school officials, who  began calling them by their new names and allowing them to use restrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity.\n\u201cThey gave me so much more than I expected,\u201d Gio said of officials at Wayne Hills High School, adding that their response made him so happy that he \"wanted to cry so bad.\"\nJonah said he was \u201clucky and grateful\u201d for the way he was treated at West Milford\u2019s Highlander Academy, and that his father\u2019s family, including a grandmother who lives in Egypt, immediately accepted him as a boy. He explained it this way: \u201cThe Koran doesn\u2019t say anything about being born in the wrong body.\u201d\nBoth boys said they knew that not every transgender child got as much support as they did, and that they had read about children committing suicide or becoming homeless after being rejected by their families. Those stories are at the heart of what some experts said is the most pressing question related to transgender policies: parental notification.\nGio Leotsakas and his mom, Nancy, said Wayne Hills High School has been accommodating, allowing him to use restrooms and locker rooms based on his gender identity.\n(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Staff Photographer)\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want schools to be in the business of outing students,\u201d said Aaron Potenza of Garden State Equality, an advocacy group for people who are gay or transgender, citing \u201chigh incidences of family abandonment\u201d for LGBT children.\nThat issue was the focus of a fierce debate when\u00a0Pascack Valley Regional High School\u00a0officials adopted a policy in April amid threat of a lawsuit by a conservative Christian legal group. While some of those opposed to the policy cited religious concerns, others said their biggest issue was its requirement for a student\u2019s consent to call parents.\nHolly Schepisi, a Republican assemblywoman, spoke against the policy in the spring, citing her concerns about lack of parental involvement. In a recent interview, she said that students struggling with gender identity needed the support of their families, but that exceptions should be made in cases where a family did not accept a student\u2019s gender identity.\n\u201cThat is what family units are supposed to be there for: to guide children through those difficult times,\u201d Schepisi said. \u201cIf there are any real concerns where a child says to a teacher or guidance counselor, \u2018My parents will never accept me this way and I\u2019m fearful for what will happen to me at home,\u2019 then I understand case-by-case scenarios where parents wouldn\u2019t participate in decisions such as this.\u201d\nMost of the North Jersey policies appear to have been adopted with little public scrutiny, with districts often approving them as part of a consent agenda, in which school boards take one vote to adopt a larger group of policies. All but a handful of the transgender policies were adopted with unanimous votes, and all but six were approved prior to the federal government\u2019s May letter.\nPastor Marc A. Stutzel of Emerson holds his son George Stutzel, while voicing his approval of the Pascack Valley Regional Transgender Policy during an April 2016 Pascack Valley Regional High School District Board of Education meeting.

Erik Gundersen, Pascack Valley Regional Superintendent.\n(Photo: Amy Newman/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER, North Jersey Media Group Staff Photographer)\nThe transgender policies remained so far off the radar last year that Governor Christie seemed unaware of them as he campaigned in New Hampshire and was asked about California transgender policies. CNN reported that Christie said New Jersey had no such issues. His office recently declined to elaborate.\n\u201cMen go to men's rooms, women go to women's rooms, and there really shouldn't be a whole lot of confusion about that \u2013\u00a0public accommodations,\u201d Christie said in December, according to CNN. \u201cAnd I don't think we should be making life more confusing for our children.\u201d\nBy then, more than two dozen North Jersey schools had adopted transgender policies, with the first being approved in 2013.\nThe following year, the U.S. Department of Education said transgender students were protected under Title IX, a federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. The U.S. Justice and Education departments issued more specific guidelines in May, saying that transgender students must be treated the same as other students of the same gender identity and framing the matter as a civil rights issue. Experts said schools could lose federal money if they did not comply. More than 20 states \u2013\u00a0New Jersey is not among them \u2013\u00a0are opposing the guidelines in pending lawsuits.\nIt is unclear what impact the election of Donald Trump as president will have on the issue, particularly in New Jersey \u2013 where some school officials have said their policies are an extension of state civil rights laws. Trump, earlier this year, was critical of a North Carolina law barring transgender people from using restrooms based on their gender identity, saying that people should \u201cuse the bathroom they feel is appropriate.\u201d He later said the matter should be decided by states and not the federal government.\nPolicies vary on key issues\nSchools disagree on notifying parents\nMost transgender policies reviewed by The Record are based on a model written by Strauss Esmay, a New Jersey company that specializes in creating school policies. But the policies diverge in significant ways.\nFor example, 28 districts list transgender students\u2019 rights, including restroom use, in some detail, while 19 simply list issues to be discussed on a case-by-case basis, without specifying the rights.\nNone of the policies go into detail about what happens when students come out as transgender and their parents disapprove, saying only that school officials would hold a meeting with families. A study by the City University of New York recently found that the risk of\u00a0suicide triples for transgender people who experience a \u201chigh level\u201d of rejection from their families.\n\u201cOf 47 transgender high school district policies across North Jersey, 10 provide some privacy protections for students from parents: Bergen County Special Services \u2022 Bergen County Technical \u2022 Lodi \u2022 Manchester Regional \u2022 North Arlington \u2022 Paramus \u2022 Pascack Valley Regional \u2022 Rutherford \u2022 Tenafly \u2022 Westwood Regional\u201d\nReporting by Abbott Koloff and Andrew Wyrich\nPhilip Nicastro, of Strauss Esmay, said parental consent might be a more significant issue than parental notification. Once students come out at school, he said, their parents are likely to find out from another student\u2019s parents regardless of whether the school calls them. But he said there was no clear guidance from government officials about what should happen next when the transgender student\u2019s parents object. The issue was not mentioned in May\u2019s letter from the federal government.\n\u201cThe letter is silent about non-consenting parents,\u201d Nicastro said. \u201cNew Jersey is silent. Nobody wants to touch it.\u201d\nThe Record asked North Jersey superintendents via email how they would handle it if a parent disagreed with a student\u2019s gender identity. Only a handful of districts responded, and typically said they would consult their attorneys in such cases.\nGio and Jonah, both of whom talked to The Record with the permission of their parents, said parental notification requirements might put some students in danger or hinder them from expressing their true selves. The districts where they came out, West Milford and Wayne, both have parental notification requirements.\n\u201cFor some kids, it\u2019s not safe to come out at home,\u201d said Jonah, who now lives with his family in another part of the state. He said he was unaware that West Milford, which adopted its policy in August, did not have one at the time he came out. Acceptance by school and family, he said, helped him \u201cto be myself\u201d and eased his anxiety and depression.\n"]]

There\u2019s also \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that cannabis is effective at preventing and treating nausea related to chemotherapy.\nThere is \u201cmoderate evidence\u201d that cannabis and cannabinoids are effective for improving \u201cshort-term sleep outcomes\u201d for people suffering sleep disturbances linked to sleep apnea, fibromyalgia and chronic pain.

It also warns that increasing numbers of children may be accidentally ingesting marijuana now that it\u2019s more widely available.\nThe evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug to trying other drugs \u201cis limited,\u201d the study says. But researchers also found \u201cmoderate evidence\u201d of a link between cannabis use and the development of substance dependence or abuse problems with alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.\nThe review of studies was an attempt to pinpoint the gaps in knowledge about marijuana use and call for rigorous research into the drug as it becomes more easily available.\u00a0\u201cThis is a pivotal time in cannabis research,\u201d the report notes.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump \u2019s nominee for U.S. attorney general, Sen.

Doblin\nThe Record\nTHE PEOPLE of Fort Lee should be overjoyed. On Friday, David Wildstein, the Snidely Whiplash of the George Washington Bridge scandal, appeared in federal court in Newark to plead guilty to two criminal counts relating to the access-lane closure. Hours later, Governor Christie took to Twitter to declare: \"I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning and execution of this act.\"\nMarko Georgiev/Staff  photographer\nDavid Wildstein exits Newark court on Friday, May 1, 2015.\nIn the days of Richard Nixon, a politician under fire would have raised his arms, made victory signs with both hands and proclaimed, \"I am not a crook.\" No one accuses Christie of being a crook, but it is remarkable that the man who is contemplating becoming president of the United States did not face reporters in New Jersey on Friday. He tweeted.\nShortly after Wildstein's court appearance, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman announced nine-count indictments against former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni and Christie's former deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly. Fishman elaborated on a scheme to retaliate against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich. Baroni and Kelly, with Wildstein, are alleged to have planned the lane closures to punish Sokolich for not endorsing Christie in his reelection campaign in 2013.\nBaroni's lawyer said Wildstein is lying. Kelly, in a press conference, said Wildstein \"is a liar\" and went further, saying it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest she was the only person in the governor's office who had knowledge of the lane closures.\nThere is much dissembling going on, and the upcoming trial will hopefully sort some of this out. But there is nothing for Christie to crow about \u2014 or even tweet. At best, three trusted allies violated the public trust all in his name. The governor wants to divorce himself of the whole affair. He authorized the spending of millions of the public's tax dollars for the so-called Mastro report that talked at length to everyone but the key players. That self-ordered report exonerated Christie, and the governor has tried to use that as a shield against criticism.\nCaptain America Chris Christie isn't; this shield does not work. If we believe Wildstein, the Christie campaign was filled with rogue players willing to toy with the lives of millions of people by closing lanes to the busiest bridge in the United States, all to get back at a Democratic mayor with little statewide influence during a campaign where a Christie landslide victory was all but guaranteed. Christie continues to say he knew nothing about the lane closures before they occurred or after. If that is how he managed an easy reelection campaign for governor, how is he managing a not-so-easy one for president?\nPrimary voters should be taking a look at the possible Christie narratives: Either he was completely uninvolved and trusted key aides ran amok or he knew about the closures sooner than he admits. The first scenario shows a governor with unbelievably bad judgment; the second, an unbelievable governor. Neither instills confidence to hand him the nation's nuclear codes.\nYet confidence was once the entire Christie package. Consider that on Jan. 9, 2014, the day after The Record broke open the GWB story linking the closing to Kelly, Christie held a lengthy press conference in the State House to declare that he had been betrayed by these people, that he fired them and that he was as shocked as all New Jerseyans were.\nOn May 1, Christie was not speaking to the media. For starters, he started the day in Virginia, not New Jersey. When he came back to the state, he didn't schedule a public event. There was a press release and numerous tweets. This is not leadership. This is not confidence. And this is not the end of the governor's problems.\nFishman did not rule out the possibility that other former Christie aides or appointees would be indicted in related issues \u2014 the specter of former Port Authority Chairman David Samson follows Christie like Banquo's ghost. Whether Wildstein is lying, as is being said by Kelly, or whether he is telling the truth, Birnam Wood is moving in on this governor with presidential ambitions.\nThere are too many people in not-good places with ties to the governor. Christie has dismissed Wildstein as a not-so-close former high school classmate, suggesting that he \u2014 Christie \u2014 was too cool to associate with Wildstein back then. That does not explain how Wildstein was given a job at the Port Authority. Kelly's statement about what is and is not ludicrous has more than a little weight.\nAs much as Christie wants to move past the GWB, he cannot. Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly were not nameless state employees far removed from the governor's office. Certainly Baroni and Kelly have a right to state their side of the story in a court of law. Fishman does not offer any rationale for the GWB scheme. Perhaps during a trial, Wildstein will, because even if all of this true, it makes little sense. It is indeed ludicrous.\nStill the people of Fort Lee have someone to blame, and it isn't Chris Christie. That would be a much easier sell if Christie had taken to a podium Friday afternoon. Even diminished, he is still larger than life face to face. But the visage I see on his Twitter account does not make him or his pronouncements look large. In fact, he looks small. Very small.\nAlfred P. Doblin is the editorial page editor of The Record. Contact him at doblin@northjersey.com. Follow AlfredPDoblin on Twitter.\n"]]

But his expectations were dashed after his mother said she received a phone call from a Scouting official who told her that Joe would no longer be allowed to participate because he was born a girl.\nKristie Maldonado said she was stunned because her son had been a member of Cub Scout Pack 87 in Secaucus for about a month\u00a0and his transgender status had not been a secret. But some parents complained, an official from the Northern New Jersey Council of Boy Scouts told her \u2014\u00a0even though her son had been living as a boy for more than a year\u00a0and was accepted as a boy at school, she said\nJoe Maldonado, 8, and his mother Kristie Maldonado, of Secaucus, talk about Joe being kicked out of Cub Scouts because he was born a girl.\n(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/Northjersey.com)\n\"Not one of the kids said, 'You don\u2019t belong here,\u2019\u201d Maldonado said of the Scouts in the pack.\n\u201cIt made me mad,\u201d Joe, said. \u201cI had a sad face, but I wasn\u2019t crying. I\u2019m way more angry than sad. My identity is a boy. If I was them, I would let every person in the world go in. It\u2019s right to do.\u201d\nJoe's case could be the first time someone has been barred from participating in Scouting because of transgender identity, said members of the LGBT community. And it comes as the Boy Scouts of America appeared to be emerging from a period of turmoil involving sexual-orientation\u00a0issues, reversing long-standing bans against gay Scouts and gay Scouting leaders over the past few years. Those policy changes were made amid an internal debate that saw at least one local council defy national Scouting decrees by hiring a gay camp counselor\u00a0and pressure brought from corporations that withheld donations from the organization.\nThe Boy Scouts did not address the transgender issue at the time, LGBT advocates said, perhaps because the organization had no written policy related to gender identity. Transgender rights only recently emerged as a national issue, often focusing on the use of restrooms based on gender identity. Dozens of North Jersey school districts, including Secaucus, have granted that right, among others, to transgender students.\nx\nShare\nJoe Maldonado, 8, of Secaucus, was a member of the Cub Scout Pack 87 before he was kicked out due to his transgender status, which had never been a secret. Danielle Parhizkaran/staff photographer\nBirth certificates for 'legal status'\nScouts won't state formal stance, but refer to documents\nThe Scouts declined to say whether they have a written transgender policy. Effie Delimarkos, the\u00a0communications director for the Boy Scouts of America, said in a statement that the organization\u2019s Cub Scouts programs are for boys age\u00a07 to\u00a010\u00a0and that \"the classification on the participant\u2019s birth certificate\u201d would be used to \u201cconfirm legal status.\u201d She did not provide additional details\u00a0and did not specify whether the Boy Scouts have ever examined gender statuses on birth certificates.\n\u201cNo youth may be removed from any of our programs on the basis of his or her sexual orientation. Gender identity isn\u2019t related to sexual orientation.\u201d\nEffie Delimarkos, communications director, Boy Scouts of America\nEarlier this year, the Boy Scouts told The Associated Press that it would admit transgender children to its coeducational programs\u00a0but not to programs that are for boys only, like the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. Yet transgender\u00a0advocates said that the issue remained largely under the radar in Scouting.\nEric Chamberlin, an executive with the Northern New Jersey Council of Boy Scouts, based in Oakland, acknowledged calling Kristie Maldonado last month but declined further comment, referring questions to Scouting\u2019s national office and saying the issue involved \"our membership standards.\"\nIt is not known to what extent the Boy Scouts\u00a0leadership has\u00a0discussed the issue of transgender Scouts \u2014\u00a0or even whether the organization's\u00a0top leaders were made aware that Joe was barred from being a Cub Scout. The president of the Boy Scouts of America, AT&T Chief Executive\u00a0Randall Stephenson, who had pressed for an end to Scouting\u2019s gay bans, did not respond to a request to be interviewed.\nDelimarkos said\u00a0in her statement that the Boy Scouts consider membership for transgender children to be a separate issue from that of gay children.\n\u201cNo youth may be removed from any of our programs on the basis of his or her sexual orientation,\u201d she said, but added: \u201cGender identity isn\u2019t related to sexual orientation.\u201d The Boy Scouts declined to directly address the situation in Secaucus or say whether local or state Scouting leaders had consulted the national office about the matter.\nPivotal moment for Boy Scouts\nJoe's case raises a question: Will the organization welcome transgender boys or exclude them?\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the Boy Scouts as a national organization have a decision to make. Are they going to exclude a transgender boy for the first time, or welcome transgender boys?\u201d\nJustin Wilson, executive director, Scouts for Equality\nThe Boy Scouts of America is not known to have rejected any Scouts over gender identity before the Secaucus case, said Justin Wilson, the executive director of Scouts for Equality.\u00a0His group advocated for Scouting to reverse its bans against gay people. He said that he does not know of any instances in which the Scouts asked for a birth certificate as as condition of membership.\nWilson said he knows of at least two transgender boys who are Cub Scouts about the same age as Joe, one in a southern state that he did not name and the other in New York. He said he did not want to be more specific because of concerns that the national organization might take steps against them.\u00a0The use of birth certificates to determine gender identity, he said, would be \u201ca new, unfair arbitrary standard\u201d for membership.\nThe Boy Scouts, Wilson said, appear to be at a pivotal point. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the Boy Scouts as a national organization have a decision to make,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to exclude a transgender boy for the first time\u00a0or welcome transgender boys?\u201d\nOn its face, Wilson said, the use of birth certificates to determine membership eligibility would allow some transgender girls to be admitted. The Boy Scouts did not respond to questions about whether they would accept a transgender girl whose birth certificate indicates she is male.\nThey also did not respond\u00a0when asked whether they would accept a transgender boy whose gender status on a birth certificate was changed from female to male. Making such a change is easier to do in some states than in others. New Jersey, for example, is among more than 20 states that require proof of sex-change surgery to alter gender status. New York and Pennsylvania don\u2019t require surgery.\nAfter the ban on gay scouts\nNational organization reversed longstanding policies during the past three years\nThe Boy Scouts put in place bans against gay Scouts and gay Scouting leaders in 1978 but reversed those policies over the past three years after membership reportedly declined and corporations held back donations. It passed a resolution in 2013 saying \u201cno youth may be denied membership\u201d based on \u201csexual preference alone.\u201d It ended the ban on gay Scouting leaders in 2015\u00a0but allowed religious organizations sponsoring Scouting troops to \u201ccontinue to select adult leaders in line with their religious beliefs on sexual orientation.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nBut even before those bans were lifted, not all Scouting councils adhered to them.\nRichard Mason, president of the Greater New York Councils of Boy Scouts, said his organization had\u00a0long accepted children regardless of sexual orientation and hired a gay Eagle Scout to be a camp counselor months before the Boy Scouts ended the national ban on gay leaders.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always thought it is important for Scouting to be in sync with the openness in society,\u201d he said.\nMason declined to discuss Scouting\u2019s transgender policies but said his organization, which covers New York City, would \u201creview our policy\u201d and determine \u201cwhether it needs to be beefed up\u201d in relation to transgender Scouts in light of \u201chow recently this issue has come about.\u201d\nGirl Scouts of the USA, which has no relationship to the Boy Scouts, has accepted transgender girls for years. The Girl Scouts said on their website that any child recognized as a girl by their family and community and who \u201clives culturally as a girl\u201d would be allowed to join.\nKristie Maldonado said that her son, Joe, \u201cwould not be fine if I put him in Girl Scouts.\"\nThe best day of Joe's life\nHaircut, coming out allowed him to live a happier life\nJoe Maldonado lives with his parents, a cat, a dog, and two hamsters in a Secaucus apartment where the curtains in his room are imprinted with Star Wars characters.\nJoe Maldonado, 8, in his room that is filled with Star Wars.

But she said she knew it was more than that by the time he was 5\u00a0and she began reading about what it means to be transgender. Last year, she allowed him to cut his hair short and come out as a boy when he began second grade at the Huber Street elementary school. He is now in third grade.\n\u201cLoved it.

Detectives at the scene followed a trail of blood from midway up the hill to the waterline of the canal.\nAccording to Woodland Park Police\u00a0Detective Lt. John\u00a0Uzzalino, Kozell was suffering\u00a0from dementia and most likely \"fell from the top of a steep hill on the east side of the canal,\" causing head trauma.

Of those who do wander, 94 percent are found within one-and-a-half miles of where they disappeared, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nKozell is survived by his wife Alice, sons Thomas (Kathy) of Pequannock and Robert (Amy) of Clifton, four grandchildren\u00a0and nieces and nephews, according to\u00a0Kozell's\u00a0obituary posted on the Marrocco Memorial Chapel website.

To explore the problem, a Student Strategic Planning Committee had been formed three years ago. Harrison, a committee member, said the first initiative was a comprehensive survey done in 2015, but he said it took 13 months for the school administration to acknowledge it.\nIn the survey, Harrison\u00a0said, \u201cwere two points, in particular, that are not controversial, at least among students and parents: the necessity to return tests and assignments before the next ones are administered, and secondly, to disallow the practice of teachers assigning homework due the next day after class has been dismissed.\u201d\nHarrison also accused some teachers of not allowing students to keep tests so that they could use them again without having to rewrite the tests.\nHe said the committee has not met this academic year and is awaiting the administration\u2019s \u201cgreen light.\u201d\n\u201cThese are ongoing problems,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why more analysis is needed.\u201d He suggested the administration is afraid to impose control over teachers.\n\u201cAre we more concerned about protecting a small minority of misbehaving teachers or the mental health of students?\u201d he asked.\nResident Catherine Dorum said the inaction on student stress was frustrating. She said block scheduling should be explored, and added she was hopeful that a forthcoming revised middle school handbook would emphasize the need for quality over quantity with homework. She cited reports that homework should be limited to 10 minutes per grade level \u2014 60 minutes for sixth graders \u2014 and that anything more becomes detrimental to learning. She also urged the district to reevaluate\u00a0the use of laptops for note-taking, saying research shows adolescents may be harming by incorporating too much technology into schoolroom aspects.\nMillburn Board of Education member Richard Gray, right, during the Jan. 9 board meeting, questions the number of committees studying student stress. Sitting with Gray on the dais are, from left, Superintendent of Schools Christine Burton, Board President Emily Jaffe, and Vice President Jesse Liu.\n\u00a0(Photo: Harry Trumbore/northjersey.com)\nJaffe said the issues would be addressed by the new Health and Wellness Committee, but at least one board member wondered whether\u00a0the issue of stress was being divided into too many separate forums.\n\u201cWe seem to have now lots of overlapping committees,\u201d said Gray, who noted that student stress was being considered by the Policy and\u00a0Student Liaison committees, and now Health and Wellness.\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to take ownership?\u201d he asked.\nBoard member Berylin Bosselman took an opposing view, making a point that the problem was bigger than student stress.\n\u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019re tasked with is \u2018the culture,\u2019\u201d Bosselman said. \u201cAll these committees are viable ways to attack this issue from all different directions.\u201d\n\u201cThere has to be a way of coordinating the work,\u201d Gray said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I come in,\u201d said Burton, making the point that she has to oversee the work of all of the committees.\n3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jITxYD\n"]]

Kranjac exercised that vote twice at the Jan. 1 organization meeting to break ties in party-line votes\u00a0and once at Wednesday's \u00a0meeting, both times siding with Republicans.\nAt Wednesday's meeting, some in the audience chastised Kranjac and borough Republicans for their decisions \u2013\u00a0such as ending the borough's relationship with the Englewood Public Library in favor of Fort Lee and removing former Mayor Joseph Parisi\u00a0Sr.'s name from the municipal building \u2014 while others praised those\u00a0decisions and chastised Democrats for the \"barrage of attacks\" on Kranjac.\nTwo council newcomers sworn in Englewood Cliffs\nToward the end of the meeting, which saw council members of both parties arguing with residents and with one another, Borough Attorney Anne Marie Rizzuto chastised\u00a0officials and the public for their behavior.\n\"I've been at a lot of public meetings and represented a lot of towns, and my firm represents a lot of towns, and I'm just going to say, both to the council members and members of the public, there needs to be a better respect and a better decorum for the process,\" she said. \"The talking back and forth and the talking over each other, all you members of council, is not appropriate.\"\nDemocrats seek voice\nDemocrats said they hope\u00a0the additional representation on the council will help give them more voice in the government.\n\"I just wish and hope that he's not going to just go along party lines,\" Democrat Councilwoman Ellen Park said of Kranjac, adding she feels there is a lack of transparency and that council\u00a0Democrats\u00a0are kept \"in the dark.\"\nPark referred to the advertisement for a borough administrator , which she said she should have had advance notice of as part of the personnel committee. Council President Carrol McMorrow, a Republican, said last week that it's normal for the borough clerk to prepare and post such an ad without alerting the council.\n\"We just ask for the same notice and transparency,\" Park said. \"[Mayor Kranjac] needs to treat us the same as he would the Republican Party.\"\nWhile there will be conflicts of opinion on the council, Park said, meeting halfway on issues would go a long way toward keeping relations amicable.\n\"I hope we get a little more consensus on the council this time around,\" Democratic\u00a0Councilman Ed Aversa said. \"Maybe having an extra difference of opinion will influence the Republicans to see things a little more open-mindedly.\"\nSpecifically, he said he wants the Democratic members to have a greater sayt\u00a0on the budget process.\n\"I don't think it'll be any easier [to get issues resolved], I just think having another voice up there might help,\" Aversa said. He added he and others on the council, such as\u00a0fellow Democrat\u00a0Gloria Oh, feel they are not listened to by the mayor when they offer\u00a0opinions and recommendations.\nAt the organization meeting, Oh had said the mayor had not spoken to her about his appointments.\n\"We are not part of the discussion, and we should be part of the discussion,\" Oh said at the meeting.\nPrevious mayors, Aversa said, spoke to members of both parties before\u00a0the organization meeting to discuss appointments and borough professionals, something he said did not happen this year or last.\n\"Give us information and let us make an informed decision that's best for Englewood Cliffs,\" he said.\nRepublicans say they're open\nKranjac said the shift on the council will not have an effect on the town, adding while he has been mayor, all council members have had a voice and ability to communicate their concerns with him.\n\"Whether or not they took the time to do that is not something I can control,\" he said, adding politics should be kept out of the borough as a workplace.\n\"If everyone does their job on the council properly and for the best interests of the borough, rather than their political party, we should never have a tie vote,\" Kranjac\u00a0said. \"The days of politics of personal loyalty are over, and it is the borough that we all must be loyal to.\"\nMcMorrow said she welcomed the\u00a0new council members and\u00a0looks forward to working with members of both parties, adding she was \"very disappointed\" when the three Democratic council members voted no on her nomination for council president, with Oh voting, \"absolutely not.\"\n\"Clearly that action is not reflective of their words that they want to work together, but regardless of their actions, I will continue to be here for them and to work for our residents,\" she said.\nShe said the Democrats on the council receive the same notice and correspondence as the Republicans.\n\"They are receiving all the information we are receiving,\" McMorrow said. \"They are being given every opportunity to participate and they are not participating.\"\nAll the policies and procedures for the town are being followed, she said, adding she is \"more than happy\" to help the new council members, William Woo and Park, learn the borough's policies and procedures.\nCouncil members Oh, Woo and Mark Park could not be reached for comment.\nEmail: curley@northjersey.com\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jFfyra\n"]]

Click here to launch .\nRelated: \u00a0 Feds: Christie allies used public resources for political vendetta; no one else to be charged in 'scheme'\nAssemblyman John Wisniewski, the Middlesex County Democrat who is co-chairman of the special legislative committee investigating the lane closings, said that \u201cthere\u2019s more to come for our committee,\u201d and added that lawmakers in New Jersey and New York should revisit their efforts to reform the Port Authority.\nRelated: \u00a0 David Wildstein pleads guilty in GWB scandal; Bridget Kelly, Bill Baroni indicted\n\u201cIt was sickening to know that there were people who were in jobs, people with great responsibility, that chose, as we suspected, the first day of school \u2026 to punish residents of the state of New Jersey for the lack of their mayor endorsing this governor,\u201d said state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, the committee co-chairwoman. The Teaneck Democrat\u2019s district includes Fort Lee, the borough at the center of the traffic jams.\nBut it was unclear on Friday how the legislative committee would proceed, and a Republican member of the panel said it should stay on the sidelines while the federal charges play out. Otherwise, she said, legislative proceedings could turn into a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\nRelated: \u00a0 Christie maintains he had 'no knowledge or involvement'\n\u201cTo what end is our panel going to do anything?\u201d said Assemblywoman Holly Schepisi, R-River Vale.\nDavid Wildstein, formerly a top executive and Christie ally in the Port Authority, said that the traffic jams on five weekday mornings were done by closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. Wildstein pleaded guilty to two charges in the case in federal court in Newark.\nWeinberg said the timing of the closures \u2014 overlapping with the first week of school, Yom Kippur and 9/11 remembrances \u2014 added insult to injury. Wisniewski said the scheme undermined democracy and added to public skepticism of elected officials.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s also wrong is the admission here that the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs \u2014 part of the governor\u2019s office \u2014 was engaged in seeking political endorsements for the governor\u2019s reelection campaign. These are very troubling admissions,\u201d Wisniewski said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to come for our committee.\u201d\nAssemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle, D-Englewood, said the charges proved that the Port Authority is in urgent need of reform. She said Christie should \u201cstop hiding\u201d and sign a bipartisan reform bill that passed in the New Jersey and New York legislatures last year. Christie vetoed the bill, but lawmakers are planning to renew their efforts.\n\u201cWhile the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office pursues justice for the residents of Fort Lee and the surrounding area who were victimized by the lane closures, the Legislature must work simultaneously to enact real reforms to end this culture of corruption once and for all,\u201d Huttle said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Governor Christie to get onboard as well.\u201d\nA Republican member of the legislative committee, Assemblywoman Amy Handlin, R-Monmouth, agreed on that point.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so painfully obvious that until we can identify the clowns, then the Port Authority is going to continue to be a circus,\u201d she said.\nSenate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, said: \u201cThese are serious charges that include the abuse of power and the betrayal of public trust.

His attorney, Joseph Monaghan, said he does not \u201cbelieve there will be any further appeals.\u201d Meanwhile, Gillman's\u00a0part-time job as recreation director \u2013 a $22,500 annual appointment\u00a0he has held for three years \u2013 is hanging in the balance.\nA review of invoices obtained from the Borough Clerk\u2019s Office through the state Open Public Records Act shows $12,945 was spent to defend Gillman, who did not return a call seeking comment.\u00a0He lost a Democratic primary election in 2012.\nThe case stems from Gillman\u2019s vote in November 2011 to introduce a bond ordinance to cover the cost of constructing a proposed community center \u2014 a project that never materialized \u2014 at the PAL complex, a park off Rivera Way. He was president of the organization at the time. Gillman also voted as councilman that year to approve paying more than $15,000 in vouchers submitted to the borough by PAL. The bills were to reimburse the PAL for coaches\u2019 safety courses, field maintenance and fees to sponsor youth sports.\nArchive: Ex-Bergenfield councilman loses state ethics ruling\nWhen the bond ordinance came up for adoption, Gillman recused himself.\nJohn Smith, a local government watchdog, filed an ethics complaint against Gillman with the now-defunct local Ethics Board in April 2012. He claimed Gillman\u2019s standing with PAL, and the affirmative votes he cast, created the perception that the councilman had a conflict of interest.\nLaura Sanders, acting director and chief administrative law judge for the state Office of Administrative Law, affirmed on Nov. 1 a prior decision by the state Local Finance Board that Gillman broke a specific part of the ethics code prohibiting government officers from acting in their official capacity in any matter where they, their families or their businesses have an interest, or a direct financial or personal involvement.\n\u201cBecause he was president of PAL,\u201d Sanders said in her eight-page opinion, \u201c[Gillman\u2019s] judgment might be affected because of a desire to help that organization further its policies through continued use of the borough\u2019s facilities.\u201d\nThe board, which is a function of the state Department of Community Affairs, adopted that judgment as its final decision on Dec. 14.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy it\u2019s over with,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI didn\u2019t win \u2013 the people of Bergenfield won.\u201d\nLast week, officials threw their support behind Gillman, saying his alleged violation was based on a \u201ctechnicality\u201d and that it was \u201cde minimis\u201d in nature.\n\u201cI understand the ruling,\u201d said Borough Attorney John Schettino, whose tenure as counsel overlapped the timing of Gillman\u2019s questionable votes. \u201cWith respect to his participation, I didn\u2019t believe it rose to the level of being a conflict.\u201d\nBorough Councilwoman Ora Kornbluth, who joined the council in 2011, likened the case against Gillman to a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t derive any benefit from it,\u201d Kornbluth said, referring to Gillman's action.\nKornbluth, liaison to the Joan Schaefer Recreation Committee, said Gillman's reappointment as recreation director was among those held over when the council reorganized on New Year\u2019s Day. Councilman Christopher Tully had announced plans to resign, and Kornbluth said\u00a0she and her colleagues wanted\u00a0his successor to be part of the vote.\n\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee he\u2019ll be reappointed,\u201d Kornbluth said, \u201cbut if it was up to me, I would reappoint him. He has brought amazing new programs to town. He goes above and beyond.\u201d\nMayor Norman Schmelz, who broke a tie to reappoint Gillman as recreation director last year, said he would do the same this year if he had to.\n\u201cNo one told him not to vote,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cAll he was trying to do was get a community center for children. He wasn\u2019t going to get rich from that.\u201d\nSchmelz credited Gillman for boosting participation in last year\u2019s Halloween parade at Cooper\u2019s Pond and drawing more attractions than ever before to Family Fun Day at Veterans Memorial Park. The mayor said the former councilman also has been instrumental in growing the Lou Harris Challenger program for children with special needs.\n\u201cThey all mean good,\u201d said Smith, the government watchdog.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just that, sometimes, they put the blinders on.\u201d\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jFGwit\n"]]

An official from MCP Real Estate and Investment Management, the initial registering agent for owner KS Broad Street\u00a0LLC, was\u00a0unwilling to speculate about the future of the property.\nThe proposal for multifamily housing at the\u00a0Ken Smith Motors site has changed over the course of the long rezoning process, which has spanned several\u00a0years and has been the subject of countless public meetings.\nThe initial pitch to the Planning Board in January 2013\u00a0called for a 114-unit luxury apartment complex dubbed\u00a0Ridgewood Station.\u00a0These details were unveiled as part of a master plan amendment application to change the zoning of several downtown parcels to allow for multifamily housing.\nHowever, the applicant, Dinallo Construction Corp., backed out of the public hearing process in December 2013. Zoning ordinances were adopted by the Planning Board in June 2015 and by the previous Village Council in March 2016. Although the ordinances are the subject of a lawsuit, the hearings with the board will move forward as scheduled.\nRepresentatives from KS Broad Street\u00a0appeared before the Planning Board on Oct. 4. At that meeting, plans for a 50-foot tall, 66-unit complex with first-floor retail were revealed. The matter is slated to be heard next on Tuesday.\nThe village collected nearly $124,800 in property taxes in 2016 for the lots that make up 9-17 Franklin Avenue. That is not expected to change significantly with the addition of the business.\n"]]

It continues on Monday.\nKaitlyn Poskay, of Oradell, brought her 3-year old daughter, Victoria, niece Madison Drimones\u00a0of Lodi, and several other family members. Poskay's husband, Chris, said their daughter had received tickets from her school.\n\"The kids had fun,\" Poskay said, calling it a \"good Sunday activity. They loved it.\"\nThe fun fair and zoo opened on the same day that Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced it would perform its final show in May after 146 years. The iconic circus cited rising costs and declining ticket sales after removing elephants from show, under pressure from animals rights advocates, as reasons for the shutdown.\nWhile not a replacement for a circus, Poskay said the format of the\u00a0Commerford's Kids Fun Fair and Zoo allowed\u00a0children to interact with animals rather than providing passive entertainment. Poskay added that she felt\u00a0bad that some of the animals were in cages. Maricel Valle\u00a0of Bloomfield, who came to the exposition center with her husband and two daughters, Audrey and Leanne, said the fair was good for children because it allowed\u00a0them to learn about different kinds of animals from various countries. The menagerie included zebras, camels, kangaroos and ring-tailed lemurs to sheep, goats and donkeys.\n"]]

The small, almond-shaped region in the temporal lobe lights up in reaction to fear, anxiety, stress or anything else that signals a potential threat (real or perceived). A healthy amygdala can help to protect the brain against stress, while an amygdala that\u2019s hyper-excitable as a result of chronic stress or other factors can amplify the stress response . \u00a0\nThe new study shows, for the first time,\u00a0how an overactive amygdala can cause heart attack and stroke. When stress triggers the amygdala, it activates bone marrow and inflammation of the arteries to create the conditions for a heart attack.\u00a0\n\u201cOur results provide a unique insight into how stress may lead to cardiovascular disease,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, a Harvard cardiologist and the study\u2019s lead author, said in a statement . \u201cThis raises the possibility that reducing stress could produce benefits that extend beyond an improved sense of psychological well-being.\u201d\u00a0\nFor the study, 293 people over age 30, all without heart problems, were measured for brain activity, bone marrow activity and inflammation of the arteries.\u00a0The researchers followed the participants for four years, from 2005 to 2008, during which time 22 participants experienced serious cardiac events.\u00a0\nParticipants with more active amygdalas (as determined by the initial brain scans) were more likely to have a cardiac event over the course of the study period, and were more likely to develop heart problems sooner than those with less active amygdalas.\u00a0\n\u201cEventually, chronic stress could be treated as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\" Dr. Ahmed Tawakol\nInflammation is known to create blockages in the arteries, which can cut off blood flow to the heart,\u00a0while bone marrow activity has been linked to blood clots \u2015 another known risk factor for heart attacks.\u00a0\nIn a small sub-study, 13 patients with a history of PTSD had their stress levels assessed by psychology, and underwent brain scans and tests of inflammation levels. Those with the highest stress levels showed the greatest amygdala activity, and also showed more signs of inflammation.\u00a0\n\u201cEventually, chronic stress could be treated as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is routinely screened for and effectively managed like other major cardiovascular disease risk factors,\u201d\u00a0Tawakol said.\u00a0\nWhen advising patients on heart attack prevention, cardiologists typically focus on things like diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity. The new findings suggest that stress management should be considered as a preventative health measure as well.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the past decade, more and more individuals experience psychosocial stress on a daily basis. Heavy workloads, job insecurity, or living in poverty are circumstances that can result in chronically increased stress,\u201d Dr. Ilze Bot, a biopharmaceutical researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands, wrote in a comment published alongside the study. \u201cThese clinical data establish a connection between stress and cardiovascular disease, thus identifying chronic stress as a true risk factor for acute cardiovascular syndromes.\u201d\u00a0\nSo, if you work in a high-pressure environment or find yourself frequently under stress, consider taking up meditation , yoga , tai chi or other research-backed stress busters to keep your heart healthy. There\u2019s a good chance that if your doctor isn\u2019t already recommending these practices, she will be after seeing the results of this study.\u00a0\nThis reporting is brought to you by HuffPost\u2019s health and science platform, The Scope.

From asking your boss for a raise to taking care of your constantly-sitting body to keeping your desk germ-free, this is adulting at work made easy.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n7 Tips for Managing Work Stress When You Get Home\nof\n\ue000\n\ue001\nYou can't rehash every annoyance or major problem with your partner every day or all you will do is sound like you're constantly complaining.    Be selective about which story you want to share and which experiences you will keep to yourself.\nEveryone should have a chance to get in the door and unwind from their own stress at work before being hit with a laundry list of their partner's issues. So don't walk in the door complaining.   Come in, change clothes, decompress and use that time to calm down and consider what things should be shared and which ones should not.\nLimit the amount of time you discuss what's stressing you. You have so little time to spend with your partner after work so don't spend it all complaining about problems. Sometimes we have rolling conversations about stressful things throughout the night.   You bring it up as soon as you get home, then again during dinner, then after dinner, and then again in bed. Have the conversation once and avoid revisiting it unless absolutely necessary.\nSpend as much time talking about non-stressful things or being affectionate as you spend stressing out.   You want to leave your partner with a positive feeling about you, instead of with a knot in their stomach.\nIf you want your partner to listen to you when you're sharing your concerns, then be sure to listen to your partner when they're sharing theirs.   Things will go better if you make eye contact and nod or comment to show agreement or react to what they're sharing. Listening while staring at the TV or reading your mobile device will make your partner feel ignored.\nOur significant others tend to be our best friends, and so we want to tell them everything that we go through both personally and professionally.   Sometimes we don't realize when that is becoming overwhelming or just too much info in too little time.    If you have a good friend, sometimes you can decide to share with that person and not bring your every concern home to your partner.\nSo many of us are glued to our phones and computers but at some point we need to disconnect for the night and relax, especially when you need time for yourself and to spend time with your spouse and kids.   You can't keep taking calls and reading emails through dinner, in the bathroom, in the bed and in the middle of a bedtime story. Choose a cutoff time to put your phone to bed and/or limit the amount of time you spend on the phone/computer so that you have time to take care of home.  I know everyone needs to do what it takes to keep their jobs, but at the same time you won't be successful at work if you're falling apart from stress and your home life is crumbling around you.   When you get home from work, try to manage your time and communications about work in a balanced way so that you can use your time at home to relax and recharge, not just rehash the day and keep the stress going.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE\nHighlight text to share via Facebook and Twitter\nanand purohit via Getty Images\nThe 'tulsi' plant or Indian basil is an important symbol in the Hindu religious tradition. Scientific Name: Ocimum tenuiflorum, also known as Holy Basil\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen it comes to embracing the benefits of Ayurveda, watching what you eat is possibly the best way to start. \u201cAhar (meaning dietary habits in Ayurveda) says that food eaten should have at least one of six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent,\u201d says Dr Rahul Dogra of the Kairali Ayurvedic Group , an institution that has been dedicated to Ayurvedic research and healthcare for over two decades. \u201cThe right foods promote sattva (purity), detox the body, and rejuvenate it as well, leading to an overall increase in immunity, physical and mental strength, and digestion.\"\nIf you are seeking to accomplish all of the above, say goodbye to temporary crash diets, and instead consume the Ayurvedic superfoods listed below. Bonus: The best part is that they are easily available!\n1. Ginger\nAnother reason to drink more masala chai! Ginger is a well-recognised anti inflammatory that stimulates appetite, and reduces intestinal pain, gas and bloating . \u201cIn Ayurveda, fresh ginger is used to battle nausea, especially pregnancy-induced vomiting. Dried ginger root works well on joint pains (mix with almond oil and rub on painful areas), as well as migraines, and helps lower cholesterol levels,\u201d says Dr Dogra, who is an Ayurvedic physician at the Kairali Ayurvedic Centre.\n2. Ashwagandha Root (Indian ginseng)\nDabur\u2019s Chyawanprash, an integral component of every Indian\u2019s childhood, contains this super-food along with 39 other essential herbs. Ashwagandha is popularly used in Ayurveda for fighting stress, anxiety and fatigue. Also used to relieve painful swelling or rheumatoid arthritis -- traditionally its leaves were applied to the painful area -- Ashwangandha is also considered beneficial for increasing sperm count in men .\n3. Amla\nPopularly known as the Indian gooseberry, this fruit has carved its own healthcare niche on account of its powerful antioxidant properties. \u201cIt also works as a digestive tonic, cleansing the colon, and removes excess heat from the body,\u201d says Dr Dogra. A rich source of natural Vitamin C and calcium, Amla is also known for its anti-ageing properties. Amla oil is directly applied to the hair as it fights dandruff.\n4. Turmeric\nCurrently trending as an international superfood , turmeric is an all rounder, thanks to its anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. \u201cIt is used to treat skin conditions, detoxify the liver and is excellent for diabetics as it lowers blood sugar,\u201d says Dr Dogra. While it can be applied directly to treat wounds, it is very beneficial when ingested, preferably when mixed in milk with some black pepper and honey.\n5. Ghee\nHere\u2019s some good news for those who like a spoonful of ghee over their rice and vegetables. \u201cClarified butter (as ghee is also known) actually lowers cholesterol , thanks to its content of omega-3 fatty acids, and helps improve heart health,\u201d says Dr Dogra. It also helps maintain healthy eyesight and skin, and trumps carbs as an excellent source of energy.\n6. Tulsi\n\u201cIn Ayurveda, tulsi leaves, ginger and cardamom boiled in water make for a healing potion to treat sore throats, headaches and chest congestion,\u201d says Dr Dogra. Tulsi juice is also effective in treating acne, as well as other skin disorders such as ring worm infections, rashes and itchiness. Regular consumption of tulsi also helps purify the blood, reduce blood sugar and build immunity.\n7. Brahmi\n\u201cBrahmi or Bacopa is used to balance the three body types specified in Ayurveda: Vata, Pitta and Kapha,\u201d says Dr Dogra, adding that this herb also helps sustain brain and nervous system functions. \u201cIt is traditionally mixed with sesame oil, and used to massage away stress and soothe the nerves,\u201d he says. Brahmi also helps improve memory power. Dr Dogra cautions though, that the herb should be consumed only after medical consultation. \"It does feature a few side-effects like stomach upsets, cramps and nausea,\" he says.\n"]]

Every year, more than 450,000 students take the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) exam, hoping for entry to the hallowed public engineering institutes located across India. Slightly more than 13,000 passed in 2010, a 3 percent success rate. (AP Photo/Saurabh Das)\nADVERTISEMENT\nOne can only imagine the pressure that forced 17-year-old Kriti Tripathi to choose death over engineering. The Rajasthan-based girl jumped to her death last week even after cracking the IIT-JEE because she did not want to pursue a career in engineering, according to the police. There are many students in India who face the same burden of expectations and have no one to turn to for emotional support.\nThe Hindustan Times reported that Tripathi's death was the fifth suicide by a student this year, and at least 56 others enrolled to the Kota coaching centres that train candidates for various entrance exams, have killed themselves in the last five years.\nWorried at this trend, a conscientious district collector of the city in Rajasthan has written an open letter to parents to let their children be, learn from them and encourage them to look at alternate career options that will help bring out their true potential.\nRavi Kumar Surpur told Telegraph that the letter was part of \"the multiple interventions we are trying to do to ease the situation that has arisen because of the constant stress and competitiveness the students face in the run-up to the actual examinations\".\n\"Doing it through the age-old classical letter seemed the best option to us,\" he said.\nAre we interested in making the child realise 'Your Dreams' at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises 'His/Her' Dreams?\n\"Are we interested in making the child realise 'Your Dreams' at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises 'His/Her' Dreams?\" Surpur asked in the thought-provoking letter.\nHere's the full text of the letter.\nDear Parents,\nOn behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.\nMy humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.\nIt is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.\nIt is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.\nWhen parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.\nGood career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.\nThere is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one's child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.\nHowever, I think we all agree that the World too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.\nArt, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.\nMany of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.\nWell, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.\nIt is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.\nEven if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition... parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.\nHowever, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide...\nDon't get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child.... Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.\nI consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.\nAm I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?\nI am sorry.... Answer is No... They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.\nA Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children.... Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.... Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth.... Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like.... One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste.... Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents.... Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.... All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do....\nAs they say \"Tip of the Iceberg\" reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.\nMany Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don't mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for.... That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts... your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results... your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness....\nIn return, what the child got was threats of performing still better...psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family.... comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors...could be anyone)... sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child's performance.\nWe need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times.... So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit...\nI need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them.... So the question I tend to hear from you is... Should parents go children's immature ways? Not necessarily....\nWell let us try to see what all good things they resisted.... Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.\nChild actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly....\nMoreover there is one thing which is certain.... Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so.... Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so....\nThey tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful...\nIn case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you....\nIt may appear strange and extremely annoying.... But there is a possibility of your child not liking you.... This comes in many forms and shades.... Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have...) etc.\nSo, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?\nAnswer again is a big No.... Your child does not dislike you... I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo....\nChildren are parents' responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so.... Parents really think good for their children's future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good... what is successful... what is the best thing.... Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of....\nWe all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.\nI am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in \"Right Child Care Practices\" and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.\nCreating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.\nUnderstanding the needs of the children... There are two extremes in this case... Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise \"Your\" dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care.... Both of them definitely do not work....\nTake time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times...Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher...\nAllow the child \"to be\" on his own terms and here I mean especially the child's engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative.... Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.\nSpend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the time.... It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child... Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him.... We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.\nJust a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise \"Your Dreams\" at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises \"His/Her\" Dreams?\nI could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.\nNothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others.... Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you....\nBe the Best Parent in the World!!!!\nI am sure there is no competition there...\nYours Sincerely\n"]]

An official from MCP Real Estate and Investment Management, the initial registering agent for owner KS Broad Street\u00a0LLC, was\u00a0unwilling to speculate about the future of the property.\nThe proposal for multifamily housing at the\u00a0Ken Smith Motors site has changed over the course of the long rezoning process, which has spanned several\u00a0years and has been the subject of countless public meetings.\nThe initial pitch to the Planning Board in January 2013\u00a0called for a 114-unit luxury apartment complex dubbed\u00a0Ridgewood Station.\u00a0These details were unveiled as part of a master plan amendment application to change the zoning of several downtown parcels to allow for multifamily housing.\nHowever, the applicant, Dinallo Construction Corp., backed out of the public hearing process in December 2013. Zoning ordinances were adopted by the Planning Board in June 2015 and by the previous Village Council in March 2016. Although the ordinances are the subject of a lawsuit, the hearings with the board will move forward as scheduled.\nRepresentatives from KS Broad Street\u00a0appeared before the Planning Board on Oct. 4. At that meeting, plans for a 50-foot tall, 66-unit complex with first-floor retail were revealed. The matter is slated to be heard next on Tuesday.\nThe village collected nearly $124,800 in property taxes in 2016 for the lots that make up 9-17 Franklin Avenue. That is not expected to change significantly with the addition of the business.\nCONNECT TWEET 6 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2iyBDdh\n"]]

Sharing a cozy couch with friends and family is great, but it's also a good opportunity to spread viruses and germs.\nIf you do feel like you got more than just socks from your Aunt Sue over the holidays, ginger can help you sweat out that cold. In addition to detoxification, ginger-induced sweats produce dermicidin . This germ-fighting agent can offer protection against invading bacteria and fungi, according to German researchers.\nIf you're looking to put a little spring in your step now that it's well, spring, count on ginger to be there whenever there are muscle aches. Just don't expect it to kick in immediately.\nA 2013 study from the American Pain Society found two grams of ginger taken daily for 11 days significantly reduced pain for people suffering from exercise-induced muscle soreness. So the next time you grab that bottle of water, add a few slices of ginger for good measure.\nSummer's prime time for training regiments, especially if you're a runner gunning for a personal best for an upcoming fall race. But all that training can take a toll on your joints. If you are detecting pain in your knees or ankles, introducing ginger to your diet can have some benefits.\nGinger contains gingerols, a collection of anti-inflammatory compounds, that block the chemical messenger that transmits the pain from inflammation to your body, according to the BBC.\nNow, not everyone's a marathon runner. Some of us are better suited for marathon of Netflix, or come fall and Thanksgiving, marathon eating. If you've found yourself biting off more than you can chew again, ginger can offer some relief.\nFor anyone who deals with indigestion, ginger can help speed up the process it takes to empty your stomach. Ginger also does double duty if you get bloated by functioning as a carminative. Carminatives help eliminate excess gas from the intestinal tract , according to Examine.com\nAnd last but not least, ginger is tasty. Ginger is popular in Asian cuisine as the spice pairs well with poultry, seafood and vegetables.\nBut don't take our word for it. Watch as Toronto chef Susur Lee whips up some of his guo tie , a dumpling dish that marries ginger with a medley of vegetables perfect for any occasion.\nRelated on HuffPost:\n"]]

(Photo: Globally Local)\nDemand was so strong for the vegan Big Mac, the burgers were sold out before the end of the five-day BBQ festival.\nMcInnes told The Huffington Post Canada he and his team went through 300 kilograms of dried chickpeas to satisfy hungry customers.\nA vegan himself, McInnes said the last time he had a McDonald\u2019s Big Mac was about four years ago. So to fine-tune his recipe, he turned to omnivore friends and family for help in taste-testing his versions.\n\u201cVegan food can really be more popular than animal-based products \u2014 even at a meat festival.\u201d\nMcInnes owns Globally Local , a business that works with farmers and suppliers to delivers organic produce and vegan products to area residents.\nAfter the success at Ribfest, he told HuffPost Canada there are plans to open a fast food vegan restaurant in London that will sell the burger.\nIt just goes to show how \u201cvegan food can really be more popular than animal-based products \u2014 even at a meat festival,\u201d McInnes said.\nAlso on HuffPost:\nBest Sources Of Protein For Vegans\nof\n\ue000\n\ue001\n\"The great Canadian hemp seed packs a whopping 10 grams of protein into a three tablespoon serving, alongside anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and calming magnesium,\"  says Vancouver-based register dietitian Desiree Nielsen. Add hemp seeds to smoothies, cereals and dips.\nAbout a quarter package of extra-firm tofu contains 11 grams of protein, in addition to a hefty dose of calcium and iron \u2014 two other minerals vegans need to pay attention to. \"Choose organic to avoid genetically modified organisms and hexane-extracted soybeans,\" Nielsen says.\nTempeh is a fermented soybean cake that is richer in flavour than tofu \u2014 seriously, you should try tempeh on a sandwich or in a rice bowl. \"A half-cup of tempeh contains 16 grams of protein. Try it crumbled in tacos or chili,\" she adds.\n\"Lentils are great for those who don\u2019t want to spend time soaking beans as they cook up quickly from a dried form,\" Nielsen says. Three-quarters cup of lentils contains 13 grams of protein and almost 5 mg of iron. Add it to soups, casseroles or puree for a creamy dip.\nThere is a reason why hummus is a powerful protein-packed food for veggies and vegans alike. \"Chickpeas are an essential part of a plant-based pantry because they are so versatile,\" Nielsen adds. Three-quarters of a cup of chickpeas contains 11 grams of protein. Enjoy them with soup, roasted with spices or even on top of a salad.\nNielsen notes edamame makes a great snack or addition to stir-fries, and contain 23 grams of protein per cup of shelled beans and almost as much calcium as a glass of milk!\nQuinoa is often touted as an excellent protein source as the protein is \"complete,\" meaning that there are no limiting amino acids, Nielsen says. \"However, it isn\u2019t as high in protein as you might expect. One cup of cooked quinoa contains 6.5 grams of protein, which is not enough to carry the whole meal. Pair it with a bean or nut for a protein-rich meal.\"\nA great snack choice or gluten-free baking ingredient, one-quarter of a cup of almonds contains 7.5 grams of protein, almost 100 mg of calcium and plenty of filling fibre. \"A cup of almond meal/flour contains 25 grams of protein,\" she says.\nDon\u2019t overlook peanuts! \"They make a great snack, or as butter, dip for fruit or baking ingredient. One-quarter of a cup of peanuts contains nine grams of protein and is a source of folate, important for women ready to start a family,\" Nielsen says. Two tablespoons of peanut butter contains 7.5 grams of protein.\nMillet, a tiny grain, cooks up fluffier than quinoa with a \u2018wheat-like\u2019 taste. \"You can even pop it as a snack. One cup of cooked millet contains 6.5 g of protein per cup; make millet porridge or serve like rice.\"\n\"Not many veggies contain a significant amount of protein but green peas are a standout, with 4.5 grams of protein per half cup,\" Nielsen says. Enjoy green peas by pureeing them into dips or soup or serve as a side dish with your favourite rice bowl.\n\"Many clients are surprised to hear that most vegetarian milk alternatives don\u2019t contain the same protein as the foods they are made from. However, soy milk made from whole soybeans, not soy protein isolates, contains eight grams of protein per cup, making it the perfect milk substitute,\" Nielsen notes. For the best amount or protein, avoid sweetened varieties of soy milk. And besides having it with cereal, you can also add it to smoothies or use it for baking. We suggest some oat, banana and soy milk pancakes!\nNot all seeds are high in protein, but sunflower seeds contain 7.5 grams of protein per quarter cup. Eat as a snack or add it to baked goods and cereals (just watch out for the salted versions).\n\"Greens are incredibly nutritious, just not necessarily for their protein content,\" Nielsen says. However, broccoli comes out on top: one cup of cooked broccoli contains four grams of protein in addition to cancer-protective phytonutrients.\nBuckwheat has nothing to do with wheat; it is a gluten-free seed that is related to rhubarb. \"It is fantastic for baking and cooking. Cooked buckwheat contains six grams of protein per cup. Add to salads, pilafs or eat as you would rice.\"\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

Such information, when sought by law enforcement, sometimes requires a search warrant. AT&T representatives did not respond to a message left at their National Subpoena Compliance Center in Florida asking if they would comply with the demand for a month of text messages sent by Regina Egea, chief of Christie\u2019s authorities unit.\nAsked about any potential legal concerns, Assemblyman John Wisniewski of Sayreville, the panel\u2019s Democratic co-chairman, said, \u201cWe have been guided by our counsel who advised us this was an appropriate way to seek information.\u201d\nThe subpoena requests all Egea\u2019s incoming and outgoing calls and text messages for December 2013.\nOn Dec. 9, Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye and two agency employees who manage the bridge testified that a Christie loyalist at the agency had ordered the lane closings. Egea told lawmakers during her hearing in July that she recalled sending Christie a text while watching the December testimony and commenting on how \u201cprofessional\u201d the Port Authority employees seemed, but she said she believed it had been erased.\nThe governor has said he doesn\u2019t recall the text message.\nDemocratic leaders of the legislative panel said on Wednesday that the phone logs and messages, if turned over by the company, would confirm whether Egea was accurate in her description of the erased communication and whether there were other text messages.\n\u201cThis is the one and only time the head of the authorities unit texted the governor about Bridgegate?\u201d asked state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Teaneck, co-chairwoman of the panel. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound very forthcoming.\u201d\nWisniewski said that the committee had only received two e\u00admails involving the governor in response to a subpoena requesting all office communications related to the lane closings. The messages, already released, concerned a statement issued about former Port Authority executive David Wildstein\u2019s resignation.\n\u201cFor someone who quite visibly uses his hand-held device to communicate, it\u2019s remarkable to have only those two communications,\u201d Wisniewski said.\nThe governor\u2019s office declined to comment on the subpoena.\nState Sen. Kevin O\u2019Toole of Cedar Grove, a Republican lawmaker on the panel who often defends the administration, also did not return a request for comment.\nThe subpoena signaled that the panel intends to continue to gather information despite its stalled efforts to call more witnesses.\nWeinberg said that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New Jersey as recently as a week and a half ago requested that the panel refrain from calling 13 people identified as potential witnesses. Federal prosecutors are conducting their own grand jury investigation.\nWisniewski and Weinberg said the committee\u2019s attorney has instead been conducting informational interviews with undisclosed people.\nWeinberg said she would also like to issue a subpoena to the governor\u2019s office, demanding a list kept by Christie staffers of 100 towns that were the focus of extensive outreach.\nOne Christie staffer, Matt Mowers, testified that the list was composed of \u201cpolitically intriguing\u201d towns, but documents turned over also show that staffers volunteering for Christie\u2019s campaign tracked endorsements from some of the officials in towns on the list.\nThe governor\u2019s office previously provided the list, referred to as the T-100 list, but all towns except Fort Lee were blacked out, she said. Democrats want to know if the Christie administration, during regular government work hours and using public resources, used the list to court political endorsements leading up to the voting last November, when the governor was reelected.\nWisniewski said the committee intended to wrap up its work \u201chopefully over the fall,\u201d before recommending legislation to reform the Port Authority. Another Democrat, state Sen. Bob Gordon of Fair Lawn, said on Wednesday that he hoped New Jersey lawmakers would act sooner on two other bills aimed at making the Port Authority more transparent, including one he co-sponsored.\nWisniewski is holding up those bills in the hope of passing a broader package of reforms, including changes in how the Port Authority is governed.\nLegislation affecting the Port Authority is subject to the approval of the legislatures of New York and New Jersey and the governors of both states. The bill proposed by Gordon, and already passed by New York lawmakers, includes a package of reforms that would impose new transparency and ethics requirements, among other things.\nEmail: boburg@northjersey.com\n"]]

We bought some Legos, some robots \u2013 they went in at a very low cost.\u201d\nThe courses focus on different topics, depending on grade level.

He ate cheap, packaged foods and hid in his home on the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne, on the border between New York state and Ontario.\nHe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see his family for 10 years. He became extremely unhealthy, and weighed 620 pounds.\nAfter a childhood of abuse and an adult life full of unhealthy habits, John Terrance eventually weighed 620 pounds.\nOne night, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca spark went off\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the courage to kill myself, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the strength to live,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Terrance told The Huffington Post Canada in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought \u00e2\u0080\u0098OK, I need to do something about this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTerrance was too heavy for gastric bypass surgery. So, he started doing long cardio workouts three times a week and lost 70 pounds in order to qualify. In 2013, he underwent the operation and began to change his life.\nAt one point, Terrance complained to a friend that his back was always sore. She suggested yoga.\nTerrance learned the basics from an instructor he knew, and then developed his own routine to do at home. He made yoga a regular part of his workout routine, which by then he was doing six days a week.\nIt was tough at first, taking a toll on his knees and joints. But he stuck with it. And then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe weight just melted off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTerrance has now lost an unbelievable 380 pounds.\nAfter undergoing gastric bypass surgery and discovering a new passion for yoga, John Terrance has lost almost 400 pounds.\nWhen many people think of medicine, they think of pills, cough syrup \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the items easy to grab at a pharmacy.\nBut to Aboriginal communities, medicine has a completely different form and definition.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat medicine means is something that makes you feel good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Mitch Baird, a communications manager for the Southern Ontario Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative (SOADI). \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing for a walk in the forest is a medicine, listening to music is a medicine.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn native culture you look at the whole person, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compartmentalize their mental health and physical health,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Baird said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat medicine means is something that makes you feel good.\"\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mitch Baird\nThat holistic approach of assessing mental, physical, spiritual and emotional health as one mirrors much of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practised in yoga. The ancient Indian discipline is \u00e2\u0080\u009cculturally appropriate\u00e2\u0080\u009d for native people, Baird said, and holds much promise for healing the illnesses plaguing them.\nDiabetes, in particular, is three to five times more prevalent in Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aboriginal communities than it is in the rest of the population, according to the Canadian Diabetes Association. In some First Nations communities, up to 26 per cent of people have the disease.\nDiabetes was extremely rare among Aboriginal people before 1940, but diet, poverty, and poor living conditions all contribute to the problem, said the association.\nFragmented health-care options and high staff turnover rates on reservations make matters even worse.\n'We need to go back to another way'\nElders have described diabetes as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe physical manifestation of the loss of a way of life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Baird said. In the past 100 years, Aboriginal peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 habits and diets have been turned upside down by colonization, he said.\nRather than hunting and eating traditional meals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat the Earth provides\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many people now only have access to highly processed foods.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of these communities are really far away from grocery stores, so their grocery store is usually the corner store,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Baird pointed out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, try eating healthy from there.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur bodies are saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We need to go back to another way.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMitch Baird, standing at far left, has certified dozens of yoga instructors to bring the practice back to their remote aboriginal communities.\nTwo years ago, Baird started offering a course to train instructors after reading about the benefits of yoga for people with diabetes.\nStudies have shown that yoga can decrease a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body mass index (BMI) and blood sugar levels, while increasing levels of vitamin C and glutathione, an important antioxidant.\nTo date, SOADI has certified 40 yoga teachers in remote First Nations communities in southern Ontario, and is now heading to northern parts of the province.\nYoga is ideal for remote communities because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require expensive equipment, Baird said. All you need is a mat.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see fancy 24-hour fitness gyms opening in Kashechewan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said with a laugh.\nYoga is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca new way of returning to a traditional way of life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Baird.\nRen\u0102\u0160e Thomas-Hill believes yoga can bring life back to traumatized First Nations communities. (Photo: Mitch Baird/Vimeo )\nIn fact, yoga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow bends and stretches recall the feelings of gathering, harvesting, and paddling a canoe, said Ren\u0102\u0160e Thomas-Hill, a respected elder of the Mohawk Nation Turtle Clan from the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a different word for body language,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she explained in a video interview with Baird. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a language we all understood a long time ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIf something feels good, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for you, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are taught that our bodies are sacred. Our bodies know what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAfter losing two nephews, Thomas-Hill said that yoga helped her move past grief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife came back into me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\nAnd it could do the same for others. Many of the communities Baird visits have been traumatized, and yoga could bring them \u00e2\u0080\u009clife: real, true life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nEvery two weeks, Baird visits the maximum-security Niagara District Detention Centre in Thorold to teach yoga.\nThomas-Hill helped him create a document explaining how the philosophies of yoga line up with traditional Anishinaabe teachings. And Baird tailors his sessions to the men based on what nation they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re from, adding phrases in their language rather than closing with the traditional Sanskrit \u00e2\u0080\u009cnamaste.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIndigenous people are drastically overrepresented in prisons, a reality the national correctional investigator has called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisturbing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhile only 3.8 per cent of Canadians are First Nations, M\u0102\u0160tis, or Inuit, they make up more than 23 per cent of the inmate population. Indigenous Canadians are incarcerated at a rate 10 times higher than that of non-indigenous citizens.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a language we all understood a long time ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ren\u0102\u0160e Thomas-Hill, Elder\nSome of the inmates in Baird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sessions combine yoga with rituals and ceremonies from their upbringing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 making it a spiritual practice, and not just exercise.\nThe biggest success he hopes for is to see a man in prison find peace for 10 minutes, he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo see them, for maybe once in a long time, calm down and chill out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big one for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA screengrab from an online video created by Mitch Baird so people can exercise at home.\nYoga holds great promise for people struggling with grief and trauma \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially the young, said Brittany Biedermann, a community wellness clinician and counsellor with Moose Cree First Nation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe things we do in counselling are almost the same as what yoga can accomplish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBiedermann moved to Moose Factory, a reserve about 850 kilometres north of Toronto, in 2011 after the community experienced a rash of youth suicides and needed a new counsellor. Many people still carry deep sorrow from that time, Biedermann said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe things we do in counselling are almost the same as what yoga can accomplish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to get young people to open up to a counsellor, Biedermann said. They often struggle to trust health workers, especially in remote communities where they may not stick around for long.\nBiedermann completed Baird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yoga training in January and it \u00e2\u0080\u009cignited a passion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can see yoga as being able to reach youth in ways that talk therapy can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my sessions, we talk about stress management and healthy ways of coping, self-care, how to redirect our thoughts and manage our emotions. And all this stuff can be learned through yoga.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTerrance, too, pointed to yoga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental and spiritual benefits. Even though it helped him lose hundreds of pounds, Terrance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite thing about the practice is the resulting mindset.\nJohn Terrance practices yoga at the fitness centre on his reservation in northern New York state.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt strengthens your focus, gives you more clarity, helps with remembering. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so many benefits, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even list it all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he raved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most noticeable one is just feeling good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTerrance practices at the fitness building on his reservation. Now when he goes to work out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is six days a week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people are waiting for him. Between three to seven regulars follow along with his yoga routine. He even teaches private classes to a few elders, who want to improve their mobility or ease aches and pains.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt strengthens your focus, gives you more clarity.\"\nThis fall, he is signed up to take Baird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s course to become a certified instructor. Then, he hopes to start \u00e2\u0080\u009ca new journey\u00e2\u0080\u009d travelling across the United States and Canada, teaching yoga to other indigenous people.\nNot only did yoga transform Terrance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, it also altered his brain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mind is clear, I have more confidence, I feel a spiritual connection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Yoga teaches you to breathe and relax, Terrance added, even when your body is twisted into unnatural positions.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI take that same mentality now into the outside world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore I was an introvert, I was really insecure. But now when I go out, that courage is my yoga pose \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holding an uncomfortable position.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAlso on HuffPost:\n11 Facts About Canada's First Nations\nof\n\ue001\nThe word Canada comes from the Iroquois word kanata meaning village, settlement or land.\nThere are currently over 60 First Nations languages in Canada grouped into 12 distinct language families, according to Statistics Canada.\nBefore European Settlers came to Canada, it was not uncommon for Aboriginal women to hold equal power to men, and even had to ability to take the power away from the chief, reports UBC. Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suffrage in Canada was not granted until 1918.\nThe North American headdress was earned, each feather representing an act of bravery.\nThere are over 600 different tribes in Canada each with their own culture and belief system.\nThe High King of France commissioned Giovanni da Verrazzano to reach Asia by sailing around North America in 1523. He described the coastline as densely populated and full of bonfire smoke, saying it could be smelt from hundreds of miles away at sea. Some academics place the American Aboriginal population at 50 million while some argue it to have been 100 million. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s First Nations population of Canada falls around 1.4 million.\nDuring the early days of colonization, Britain saw Aboriginal people as essential to protecting their colonies and considered them powerful allies who helped battle the French during the Seven Year War and fought off American invasion during the War of 1812.\nFirst Nations people played a major role during the fur trade between the 17th and 19th centuries, which attracted merchants from around the world.\nArchaeology tells us that aboriginal people have lived in the Maritimes provinces of Canada for at least 11,000 years.\nAfter the decline of the fur trade and the end of the War of 1812, more settlers came to Canada, creating a large enough population to protect their own borders. First Nations were seen as impeding on economic development and were sent to live on isolated reserves, while more land was set aside to accommodate new settlers.\nAboriginal people have the youngest demographic in Canada, with a median age of 28, while the median age for non-aboriginal Canadians is 41.\nConservative leader Stephen Harper's wife Laureen dances with Vinay Virmani as they attend a campaign event in Brampton, Ontario on Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015.\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau makes a funny face with a young child during a campaign stop at a restaurant, Oct. 14, 2015 in Welland, Ont.\nNDP leader Tom Mulcair and his wife, Catherine help their grandson, Raphael, onto a giant pumpkin while visiting a farm, Oct. 14, 2015 in L'Assomption, Quebec.\nConservative Leader Stephen Harper is photographed by a supporter as he attends a campaign event at the J.P.

Mulcair, a former Quebec Liberal, denies he ever intended to run for the Tories.  However, several other prominent Canadian politicians have changed their political stripes.  (Information courtesy of The Canadian Press' Stephanie Levitz)\nAccording to several biographies of the current Conservative prime minister, when he was in high school in the 1970s, he ran in Liberal circles.  The prime minister of the time was Pierre Trudeau, and Harper was recruited by one of his classmates to join his high school Liberal club.  But soon after graduation, Harper moved west and as the story goes, lost respect for the elder Trudeau over the implementation of the national energy program, beginning his long road to leader of the Conservative party.\nTrudeau also prompted Rae to get involved in politics, where he got his first taste of the life volunteering for the Liberals.  After returning from studying in England, he joined the New Democrats, eventually being elected as an NDP MP before leaving Ottawa to lead the provincial NDP and becoming premier of Ontario.  In 1998, he resigned from the NDP but didn't sever political ties with them until 2002.  That year, he argued in an essay published by the National Post that he no longer supported the party's approach to the Middle East and its opposition to the World Trade Organization.  \"This is not a vision of social democracy worthy of support,'' he wrote at the time.  In 2006, he declared his allegiance to the Liberals, running for its leadership but losing.  He became a Liberal MP in 2008 and the party's interim leader following the 2011 election.\nMulcair named former Conservative cabinet minister Lawrence Cannon as the one who approached him to join the Conservatives.  The duo knew each other from their days with the Quebec Liberals; Cannon represented that party in the Quebec National Assembly for nearly 10 years before Mulcair joined their ranks.  And Cannon backed Sheila Copps when she ran for leadership of the federal Liberals in 2000.  But he then left the party for the private sector, reportedly disillusioned over Jean Chretien's handling of the 1995 Quebec referendum and the subsequent sponsorship scandal.  He went back into municipal politics for a time and then joined the Conservatives.  \"The decision of Lawrence Cannon to join the Conservative party will help us build a new, clean federalism in the province,'' Harper told a 2005 press conference announcing Cannon's candidacy.  He was elected in 2006, serving in two cabinet posts before losing his seat in the 2011 election and being appointed ambassador to France.\nThe chance to represent Canada abroad also appeared to lure David Emerson across the aisle.  The long-time businessman was wooed by the Liberals to join their party for the 2004 election and he was elected in a Vancouver riding that year, going on to become industry minister.  In the 2006 election he ran for the Liberals again, repeatedly attacking the Tories, and won his seat. That campaign saw the Harper Conservatives eke out a minority government victory.  When Harper and his team showed up at Rideau Hall to be sworn in, Emerson was with them and was named international trade minister.  The Toronto Star had reported that while in the Liberal cabinet, Emerson had objected to a softwood lumber deal the government was close to disclosing. Emerson told reporters he made the partisan switch to serve his constituents better.  \"I am pursuing the very agenda that I got involved to pursue when I was in the Liberal party supporting Paul Martin. I'm continuing to pursue it,'' he said in 2006.  He did not stand for re-election in 2008.\nThe Nova Scotia MP was first elected in 1997 as a Progressive Conservative and in 2003 ran for the leadership of that party, losing to Peter MacKay.  Though later that year he voted in favour of the PC's merging with the Canadian Alliance to form the new Conservative party, only days after the merger he announced he was going to sit as a Liberal.  In later interviews, he said he was told by those in the Canadian Alliance, including Stephen Harper, that the fact he was gay wouldn't hold back his political career within the new party.  But he said he was also told the Conservatives would continue to champion issues that were important with its socially conservative base.  \"I could not run for a party that I did not want to win the election,'' Brison said in a 2006 interview.\nThe Toronto-area Tory sent a shock through political circles when she showed up alongside Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau at a news conference earlier this year and announced she was joining his team.  Adams had long ties to the Conservatives dating back to the Mulroney days, and had been elected for the party as an MP in 2011, winning a coveted suburban riding away from the Liberals.  Eventually, she became romantically linked with Dimitri Soudas, Harper's former director of communications who went on to become executive director of the party.  He lost that position after being accused of meddling in her nomination campaign for the 2015 election, which eventually led to both of them being excommunicated from the party.  When Adams announced her decision to join the Liberals, she said it was because she no longer supported the Conservatives' policy approach, specifically their income splitting policy.  \"I cannot support mean-spirited measures that benefit only the richest few,'' she said.  She has yet to be formally nominated as a Liberal candidate for the upcoming election.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

Loretta Weinberg at an earlier joint investigative committee hearing.\nBy SHAWN BOBURG\nstaff writer\u00a0|\u00a0\nThe Record\nThe leaders of a legislative panel investigating the George Washington Bridge lane closures want to call 13 more people to provide sworn testimony, including members of Governor Christie\u2019s office and top officials at the Port Authority, according to a document obtained by The Record on Thursday.\nThe list signals Democratic lawmakers\u2019 intention to carry on with the inquiry \u2014 which has faced Republican resistance \u2014 well into the summer and possibly beyond. It includes a top political strategist for Christie, Michael DuHaime; Christie\u2019s former chief counsel, Charles McKenna; and the director of the unit that oversees independent authorities, Regina Egea. Top Port Authority officials and the Fort Lee mayor are on the list.\nIt was compiled by the two Democrats who together head the joint legislative committee, state Sen. Loretta Weinberg of Teaneck and Assemblyman John Wisniewski of Sayreville, and has been circulated to other members of the committee.\nBut it remains to be seen if federal prosecutors, who are conducting a criminal probe, will object to any of the individuals testifying.\nNew Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman\u2019s office requested last month that previously scheduled testimony by Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye be postponed. Democrats remain interested in calling on Foye, who is on the list, as is his New Jersey counterpart at the Port Authority, Deputy Executive Director Deb Gramiccioni. Gramiccioni worked in Christie\u2019s office as a deputy chief of staff at the time of the lane closures.\nThe committee has tentatively scheduled its next meeting July 8.\nWeinberg said the committee\u2019s attorney was waiting to hear from Fishman\u2019s office whether it had any objections. After that, the committee leadership expects to decide the order of the potential witnesses, she said.\nThe Democratic-led committee has used its subpoena power to gain access to documents and compel testimony, but some of the central figures in the scandal have refused to turn over records or testify before the committee, asserting their constitutional protection against self-incrimination.\nRebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Fishman\u2019s office, declined to comment on the list Thursday. The governor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening. Neither did a Port Authority spokesman.\nThe explosive e-mails and text messages, obtained and first reported by The Record, sparked a political firestorm that extended far beyond New Jersey and Fort Lee. For full coverage, click here .\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone overboard at this point,\u201d said Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick. \u201cIf you have politicians investigating politicians, it will never end.\u201d\nAn attorney for one of the individuals, Port Authority police union President Paul Nunziato, said his client would be willing to come before the committee. Nunziato has already spoken with federal prosecutors.\n\u201cPaul Nunziato has and will continue to cooperate with all valid investigatory bodies,\u201d said Charles Sciarra.\nOthers on the list: Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich; Philippe Danielides, former senior adviser to former Port Authority Chairman David Samson; Phillip Kwon, deputy general counsel at the Port Authority; Nicole Crifo, former senior counsel in Christie\u2019s Authorities Unit and currently Gramiccioni\u2019s chief of staff; Evan Ridley, an aide to the governor; Christopher Porrino, governor\u2019s chief counsel; and Paul Matey, governor\u2019s deputy chief counsel.\nWeinberg said she would like to see the legislative committee\u2019s inquiry finished by September.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that\u2019s when we\u2019ll be ready to say whatever we\u2019re going to say about this,\u201d she said.\nRepublicans on the committee have criticized the investigation as an attempt to score points against Christie instead of fixing the Port Authority. A report commissioned by Christie\u2019s office found the governor had no prior knowledge of the lane closures.\nEmail: boburg@northjersey.com\n"]]

(Photo: Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\nThe service said the proportion of deaths where toxicology tests detected fentanyl jumped to about 60 per cent and that the drug was either used alone or in combination with other drugs.\n\"That scope is alarming. It's frightening and it's something that all of us should be concerned about,\" Clark said at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, where she was flanked by police, ambulance and firefighting officials, as well as addiction experts.\nHealth Minister Terry Lake said various federal agencies would join forces to deal with other public health crises, which he said needs to happen as B.C. fights a rising death toll that prompted the province to declare a public health emergency in April.\n\"If this were SARS or Ebola, Health Canada and border security and immigration would all be focused on this as a health issue that is essentially like a pandemic,\" Lake said. \"I think when we put our minds to it we can do these things even though they appear to be difficult.\"\n\"If this were SARS or Ebola, Health Canada and border security and immigration would all be focused on this as a health issue that is essentially like a pandemic.\"\nClark said B.C. is forming a joint task force involving the provincial health officer and the director of police services to identify ways to prevent and respond to overdoses.\n\"They'll have two main goals: to get those deadly drugs off our streets and to get people the help that they need,\" she said.\nClark said the province will improve access to treatment regimes, including its opioid substitution program, and will launch a public education campaign to draw attention to the dangers of laced drugs.\n\"Drug overdoses are absolutely senseless deaths. Every one of them is a preventable tragedy that families feel in the worst possible way,\" she said.\n\"Some have lost their lives to a tainted pill at a party. They didn't know what they were taking. Others were taken by that needless burden of addiction that they can't kick. We need to support all of them.\"\nThe B.C. Centre for Disease Control also released measures on Wednesday it believes will help tackle the problem after meeting with public health officials and the coroners' service.\n\"Drug overdoses are absolutely senseless deaths.\"\nIt wants to expand the availability of naloxone to reverse overdoses, expand access to opioid substitution treatments like suboxone and methadone and increase checks on street drugs, among other things.\nLeslie McBain, whose 25-year-old son Jordan Miller died in February 2014 after becoming addicted to prescribed oxycodone for a workplace back injury, said she's hoping the task force will consider the efficacy of safe-injection sites and more services to keep vulnerable people alive.\n\"We couldn't find the support that he needed, either medical support or psychological support and so on,\" McBain said of her son, who relapsed after going into detox.\nBetter training needed for family doctors: expert\nDr. Keith Ahamad, an addictions specialist, said more family doctors must be trained in recognizing and preventing addiction, similar to other chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.\nThat's the only way people dealing with addictions will stop bouncing in and out of emergency departments where staff are overwhelmed, he said.\nAhamad said St. Paul's Hospital will open an addiction medicine clinic in the coming months to treat patients from throughout British Columbia.\n\"We're going to be helping stabilize patients and transitioning them back to their doctors' offices with very comprehensive plans in place.\"\nAlso on HuffPost:\n"]]

It makes more sense.\"\nThe website for the Canadian Integrative Network for Death Education and Alternatives says a death midwife offers support such as bathing the \"death journeyer\" and guidance to families regardless of whether they use a funeral home. It also compares the role of a birth midwife to a death midwife.\nA spokesperson for the network could not be reached for comment.\nAerts said those who call themselves death midwives could instead go with the term death doulas.\n\"Personally, I think the terminology doula is clear. It makes more sense. I understand the parallels to midwifery and why they're using it, but doula connotes that supportive role and it's not a restricted title.\"\nSarah Kerr, a death midwife in Calgary, said the College of Midwives of Alberta has not contacted her about using the term.\nHowever, Sheila Harvey, registrar of the College of Midwives of Alberta, said the college does not support anyone's use of the title midwife without specific training for the job but that the college is not yet an independent body under the Health Professions Act so it can't take action against people who use the title.\n'We're all on the same team'\nKerr said she opted to call herself a death midwife instead of a death doula when she started her business three years ago because \"the sound of it appealed to me more.\"\n\"I'm not so concerned about titles,\" she said. \"I'm more concerned that families have options. This is a whole new field and right now it's calling itself death midwifery and it's a lay person's movement of people stepping forward and offering different services and support to dying people and their families.\n\"We're all on the same team, birth midwives and death midwives. Birth midwives fought very hard decades ago and even more recently to make options available for families. And death midwives are doing the same thing.\"\nKerr said she provides a variety of services depending on a family's wishes, such as facilitating a storytelling circle about the dying person or a \"living funeral\" where people gather to say goodbye.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\ue001\n\"One of the most wonderful doulas there is!\"\n\"Her voice grounds you to the present, centers you, supports you and encourages you to surrender.\"\n\"The doula in the photo also serves in the National Guard.

The doula is using essential oils to help mom relax and better cope with nausea. Doulas are a great support for families needing C-sections, before, during and after the cesarean.\"\n\"This mama had the support of her husband and doula as she welcomed her third daughter.\"\n\"Doula, Djifa Jones, has just arrived at her client's home on the day of her baby's birth. She would support her client for another 12 hours before her baby girl was born.\"\n\"This stunning mama braces herself through transition contractions,  almost ready to meet her sweet baby.  Her doula,  not leaving her side,  calms and steadies her all the while knowing she will be holding her baby in her arms soon.\"\n\"Sometimes just being quietly present is more than enough support.\"\n\"In Venezuela most of the births occurs in the OR -- that's why the doulas are wearing scrubs.\"\n\"Let the tears flow.\"\nThis photo was taken at a birth in Brazil.\n\"While this mother unleashes her power in the final moments before baby comes, her doula tenderly holds her hand.\"\n\"This was an HBAC, home birth after cesarean.

During the pushing phase, she received amazing encouragement, telling her she is strong and capable.\"\n\"While doulas are providing physical support and comfort measures to the laboring mother they also can be a calming presence and provide emotional support to the entire family.\"\n\"I love the way the doula is mirroring Mama in this image, just being in the moment with her.\"\n\"The attentive Doula assists mother and baby in nursing.\"\n\"This was the third time the mom, doula, and myself walked around the neighborhood. Mom\u2019s contractions were getting stronger and much closer together and she was getting closer to transition.\"\n\"Mom was close to birthing her baby. The warm water on her back, and her husband applying counter pressure helped make mom more comfortable during contractions.\"\n\"As a Doula, one of the sweetest moments of birth is when you gaze upon that fresh baby for the first time. You have imagined what that little babe was going to look like for so long.\"\nHome birth in Venezuela.\n\"This mother submitted to the birth process so beautifully, with her wonderful doula by her side.\"\n\"Mom's labor was very quick and intense. We arrived at the birth center and her beautiful babe was born less than 30 minutes later.  She relied heavily on the strength of her Doula to help her through her intense contractions.\"\n\"You are not alone.\"\n\"Mom's Doula was helping her through a series of contractions that were coming right on top of each other, explaining that squatting down into the contraction might help ease it up a bit and allow her body to work with it. Through the toughest part of her labor she had continual support of her birth team, relying heavily on her doula.\"\n\"In the moments just before these parents met their baby, this doula's reassuring and peaceful presence held a safe and sacred space. She was a mother figure of the most ancient kind.\"  OR \"Attending a birth where doula support is involved never ceases to amaze me. The skilled way in which a doula is able to remind a woman of her own power with just a touch, a word, or a look is an incredible thing to witness.\"\n\"An amazing Doula lovingly looks at this sweet girl for the first time in her daddy's arm and so many emotions are running through her, not only are these her clients but also her close friends. The feeling is so overwhelming.\"\n\"As labour intensifies this mama holds on tightly to her doula and they slow dance in the hall, breathing together in perfect unison. She is her safe space.\"\n\"This mama had such an powerful birth team that consisted of her husband, sister, midwives and doula. The support was astounding, It truly does take a village.\"\n\"Extra comfort and reassurance that your body can handle birth.\"\n\"Helping mom and baby find a comfortable position and latch shortly after birth to begin their breastfeeding journey.\"\n\"Moments before her baby is born, mom takes a moment to focus during an intense contraction assisted by her doula and husband. \"\n\"A doula helps siblings understand what's happening and how they can support their mama in the birth tub.\"\nDoula-assisted birth in Venezuela.\nBabywearing doula assists mother.\n\"Surrounded by love and support of her doula (who happens to be her best friend), husband and midwife, she finds her inner strength and brings her daughter into the world peacefully.\"\n\"The calm before the most intense, beautiful, emotional moment in your life. When you don't think you can do it anymore but your doula is there to say that you CAN and you ARE.\"\n\"A doula supports mom in the kitchen as labor picks up.\"\nDoula at a C-section birth in Brazil.\n\"Mamma had just given birth moments prior and mum dad and doula sat down to soak in baby. it was a glorious moment of all that hard work. It was a reflective and celebratory moment.\"\n\"One of the greatest things a laboring women can feel during labor is love and support.\"\n\"Time to let mom get out of the pool so we can try nursing!\"\n\"After the birth of her first child left this mom feeling defeated and without choices. she decided to hire a doula for her second birth.\"\n\"Centering might just be the only thing that a doula can do to help a mother. As this doula places one finger on the mom's third eye chakra she centers her into her focus.\"\n\"C-sections rates in Venezuela are super high (70 to 90 percent) -- that\u00b4s why their work as doulas supporting mammas to have vaginal births are very important.\"\n\"In the final hours of a long and intense HBAC (Homebirth After Cesarean) journey that ultimately inspired both women to become professional doulas themselves.\"\n\"A busy delivery room: keep me focused.\"\n\"Laboring mother surrounded by her doulas: electrifying joy.\"\n\"A mother's hands holding onto the support of a doula: I trust you, hold me through this wave.\"\n\"Doula Sarah Mills helping her client relax prior to her caesarean birth.\"\nHands clutched during a water birth in Brazil.\n\"A doula is like a trail guide, familiar with the path, she keeps you hiking through the hard parts, knowing the view at the end is incredible.\" -- Mother Strong Doula\n\"Just moments after being placed on her mother's chest, the excitement is felt by all. After over 12 hours side by side, this connection between mother and doula is absolutely heartwarming.\"\nDoula assists mom during a birth in Brazil.\n\"Doula Kimberly Davis, applies counter pressure during the mother's contraction while a nurse check's the baby's heart rate.\"\n\"The laboring mother was nearing transition, her body took over they turned off her Pitocin and she labored naturally with the help of her awesome doula and husband.\"\n\"This photograph shows the doula continuing support after baby is born.

W-18 is a similar opioid that has recently been found in Alberta. (Photo: Getty)\nIn 2015, fentanyl was to blame for 274 overdose deaths in Alberta, according to the province's government.\nAlberta Health distributed nearly 10,000 naloxone overdose kits designed to temporarily reverse an opioid overdose, in an effort to fight back against fentanyl's growing hold on the province.\nThe take-home kits are available at harm-reduction agencies, as well as pharmacies and walk-in clinics with a prescription.\n\"We don't know if W18 is binding to the same receptors in the brain that... naloxone bind to.\"\nThe kits, however, might not reverse a W-18 overdose, largely because the way the drug works is unknown.\n\"There is very limited information on the pharmacology of W-18 so we don't know if W-18 is binding to the same receptors in the brain that opioids, such as heroin and morphine, and opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, bind to,\" harm reduction specialist Ashraf Amlani told the Globe and Mail.\nAnother issue is the drug's strength. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control believes W-18 may be too powerful for naloxone to work, Global News reported.\nMay be a potential cure for overdoses\nThere is one small piece of good news. The formula behind the drug might also hold the key to an equally strong cure.\nUniversity of Alberta scientists first developed the drug in the 1980s, according to the National Post.\nThose scientists, who never tested the drug on humans, looked at both opioids and antidotes.\n\"In addition to the ones that had varying degrees of analgesic activity there were also compounds that were developed in that series which were actually antagonists , they would actually block the actions of things like morphine at the receptor, so it had no effect,\" retired U of A professor Ed Knaus told the Calgary Sun.\nNaloxone option for now\nUntil another cure is developed, health officials say the current best option for W-18 users is still naloxone.\n\"If people are exposed to W-18 and they have symptoms of overdose , same as fentanyl, they should take naloxone and call 911,'' Dr. Laura Calhoun of Alberta Health Services told The Canadian Press.\n\ue000\n\ue001\nHardy and Amelia Leighton, both in their 30s, were found dead July 20, 2015, leaving behind their two-year-old son Magnus.

From July 7 to Aug. 7, 2015, fentanyl was detected in at least 12 deaths, said the BC Coroners Service.   In 2012, there were a total of 15 deaths related to the narcotic.\nJack Bodie, 17, and a 16-year-old friend were both found unconscious in a Vancouver park on Aug. 1, 2015 in a suspected fentanyl overdose.   The teens were rushed to hospital where Bodie was placed on life support but he died a day later. His friend recovered and was released from hospital.   Police believe the pair took fake Oxycontin.\nPolice in Delta, B.C. said it's a miracle that no one died after nine people overdosed within a 20-minute period on what are believed to be drugs laced with fentanyl.  Emergency crews responded to a series of nearly simultaneous calls from four locations about recreational drug users who thought they were taking cocaine.\nFake Oxycontin pills containing fentanyl are displayed during a news conference at RCMP headquarters in Surrey, B.C., on Sept. 3, 2015. Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more toxic than morphine.\nThe cheap synthetic opioid often added in drug labs to heroin or Oxycontin to make it more potent and fast-acting, according to police.   (Pictured is a photo released by Vancouver police of packages of fentanyl which users thought were heroin.)\nNorth Vancouver RCMP said they suspect the death of a 31-year-old man on July 31, 2015 is also linked to fentanyl. A relative found the man in distress and called police, but he died at the scene.\nOn Aug. 9, 2015, 16 people overdosed in Vancouver \u2014 including six in one hour \u2014 from pink heroin that police suspect was laced with fentanyl.\nMounties showed off equipment, pills, money and weapons seized from a counterfeit Oxycontin production facility in Burnaby in 2015. They said there was enough fentanyl pills to put 200 to 300 people's lives at risk.

(Photo: The Associated Press)\n\"The numbers are continuing to be extremely high,\" Lake said. \"We're on track for a record year.\"\nUpdated numbers released Thursday by the BC Coroners Service showed the deadly opioid was linked to nearly half of more than 250 overdose deaths tallied for the first four months of this year.\nThat's compared to about a third of the 480 overdose fatalities for all of last year.\n\"Definitely, fentanyl is a big, big part of what's going on,\" Lake said.\nThe emergency declaration\u00a0made in\u00a0April allows health officers to collect information in real time\u00a0to identify patterns and respond with preventative measures by targeting certain areas and groups of people.\u00a0The step reduces the lag of waiting for data from the coroner's office.\nNumber of deaths increasing despite emergency declaration\nBut the\u00a0number of deaths has continued to grow, despite increased outreach initiatives, aggressive awareness campaigns and the rapid distribution of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.\n\"With the declaration of the public-health emergency, with increased availability of naloxone (and)\u00a0with the increased number of first responders available to administer it, I'm hopeful that this month we'll start to see those numbers come down,\" said Lake.\n\"But it really is something that we have to continue to talk about, to make sure people are very aware.\"\nB.C.'s medical health officer Perry Kendall said he wasn't surprised by the update.\n\"(Overdose deaths) haven't gone down yet, but I didn't really think that they would have,\" he said on Thursday.\n\"This obviously means we need to work on them.\"\nKendall predicted last month that if the number of fatalities continued to rise\u00a0at this rate, the total could exceed 800 by year's end.\nThe Fraser Valley region leads the province\u00a0with a total of 76 overdose deaths in the first four months of 2016. That's followed by 66 deaths in Metro Vancouver and 54 on Vancouver Island. There have been 45 overdose fatalities in the Interior and 15 in Northern B.C.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\ue000\n\ue001\nHardy and Amelia Leighton, both in their 30s, were found dead July 20, 2015, leaving behind their two-year-old son Magnus.

Police believe the pair took fake Oxycontin.\nPolice in Delta, B.C. said it's a miracle that no one died after nine people overdosed within a 20-minute period on what are believed to be drugs laced with fentanyl.  Emergency crews responded to a series of nearly simultaneous calls from four locations about recreational drug users who thought they were taking cocaine.\nFake Oxycontin pills containing fentanyl are displayed during a news conference at RCMP headquarters in Surrey, B.C., on Sept. 3, 2015. Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more toxic than morphine.\nThe cheap synthetic opioid often added in drug labs to heroin or Oxycontin to make it more potent and fast-acting, according to police.   (Pictured is a photo released by Vancouver police of packages of fentanyl which users thought were heroin.)\nNorth Vancouver RCMP said they suspect the death of a 31-year-old man on July 31, 2015 is also linked to fentanyl. A relative found the man in distress and called police, but he died at the scene.\nOn Aug. 9, 2015, 16 people overdosed in Vancouver \u2014 including six in one hour \u2014 from pink heroin that police suspect was laced with fentanyl.\nMounties showed off equipment, pills, money and weapons seized from a counterfeit Oxycontin production facility in Burnaby in 2015. They said there was enough fentanyl pills to put 200 to 300 people's lives at risk.  Riley Goodwin, 26, of Vancouver, has been charged with production and possession for the purposes of trafficking.\nRCMP Cpl.

It caused more than 30 overdoses and one death that month.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

It's got the usual hallmarks of raves: bumping music, crowds of hundreds of people and lots of strobing lights.\nBut there's a few key differences. For starters, there's no booze. Just freshly brewed coffee and pressed juice. The attire's changed up too, with participants trading in typical clubbing outfits for athletic gear. Oh and forget the late-night/early morning after mission to get back home.\nThat's because Daybreaker takes place around 6:00 a.m. on weekdays.\nIts current iteration comes courtesy of a New York group of friends who wanted to combine mindfulness, wellness, self expression, camaraderie and mischief with the vibe of a late-night party.\nCurious? You can check out the video above for a taste or relive the Toronto session here.\nRelated on HuffPost:\nMorning, Afternoon And Evening Stretches\nof\n\ue001\nStart Your Day With These 5 Simple Stretches\nThere are different variations of this stretch, but because it's still morning and we want to be gentle with our bodies before our muscles are warmed up, let's start by lying on our backs.   With arms spread out to each side, keep your feet flat on the floor with your knees bent to 90 degrees. Now, slowly let your knees fall to one side. Take a few deep breaths and relax into this position. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat on the other side.\nSitting up, either on the floor, a chair or on the side of your bed, take a deep breath and reach one arm overhead. Let your body create a nice big arc as you go into a side stretch. Hold for about 15 seconds and repeat on the other side.\nThis is one of my personal favourite stretches, because your whole body is active and you feel it from the top of your head right down to your toes.   Start by standing tall at the foot of your mat. Slowly roll forward and walk your hands forward until your body is in an inverted V position. Spread your fingers while you press your palms into the floor. Shoulders are lengthening down your back and away from your ears. Feel your glutes reach up toward the ceiling as you stretch your hamstrings and reach your heels to the floor. If you have to bend your knees slightly, that's okay. Hold for 20 seconds and repeat three times.\nThis stretch can be done standing or lying down, but let's take it easy since it's the morning.   Lying face down on your mat, gently engage your abdominals while pulling your left heel toward your glutes. Feel your hips opening into the mat as you get a stretch in your left quadriceps. If you aren't flexible enough to reach back with your hand, simply use a belt or a stretch band to help yourself out. Hold for 20 seconds on each side.\nLying on your stomach, legs about hip distance apart and hands under your shoulders, gently press your torso up while opening your chest toward to the ceiling. Keep your stomach muscles engaged so that you don't put pressure on your lower back. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat three times.\nNext: Stretches To Get You Through The Afternoon Slump\nSitting up straight on a chair, plant your feet on the floor. Gently tilt your head to the right side toward your shoulder. Place your right hand on the left side of your head and gently press down to deepen the stretch. Hold for about 30 seconds, and then repeat on the opposite side. Next, clasp your hands behind your head and very gently press your chin down toward your chest. In order to target the back of your neck, it's important to keep your spine as straight as possible.\nSitting up tall, clasp your hands and reach them up above your head. Gently arch your back, while maintaining the feeling that you are getting taller and longer. Keep breathing in and out through your nose as you hold this stretch for about 10 seconds. Now, gently arch your body to the right, hold for 10 seconds, and then to the left for another 10 seconds. Repeat as necessary throughout the day. Another great option is to clasp your hands behind your back, as you open your chest toward the ceiling.\nStart by sitting tall at the edge of your chair with both feet on the floor. Cross your right ankle over your left knee. Now without rounding your back, reach your body as far forward as you can. Hold for about 20 seconds, and then repeat on the other side.\nReach your right leg forward into a lunge, dropping your left knee toward the ground without making contact. Keep your upper body straight and tall as you hold the lunge for about 15 seconds. Use your desk or the back of your chair for support if needed. Repeat on the other side.\nReach your legs out in front you, rock back on your glutes and curl your body forward while keeping your gaze just past your toes. Hold for 20 seconds and repeat.\nNext: Easy Evening Stretches The Will Relax Your Mind And Body\nBegin on all fours with hands shoulder-width apart and knees beneath your hips. Bring your right knee forward between your hands and rest it next to your right wrist. Your right heel should be beneath or close to your left hip. Stretch your left leg straight back behind you. Keep your hips facing forward and square with the front of your mat. Hold your body in an upright position for 10 counts, and then reach your body forward and feel it relaxing into the floor. Hold for 20 seconds and repeat with the left leg forward.\nThe very name of this exercise makes me happy! Lying on your back, lift your legs and bring your knees toward you. Reach your arms between your knees to grasp your big toes or the outsides of your feet if you can. Bring your tailbone back down to the floor. Let your knees fall down to the sides wider than your shoulders, and breathe deeply for 20 seconds. Rock gently from side to side to help release your back.\nLying on your back with your arms to the side (palms facing the floor), bend your knees so that your feet are on the floor, hip distance apart, and your toes are pointing forward. Take a deep breath and gently lift your hips toward the ceiling, keeping your body in a straight line. Hold for about 15 to 20 seconds and repeat.\nLying on your back with your glutes against the wall, stretch your feet and legs up against the wall. Take a deep breath and simply relax. You can rest your hands and arms wherever feel comfortable. You will love this restorative post if you are on your feet all day. Remain in this pose for as long as you need.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

Those firms are being paid $340 per hour.\nAnd it is in addition to the money spent by the Christie administration on its own probe of the lane closures, which concluded that the governor did not know of the plan. The final tally for that probe has not been released, but bills for work by the Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher law firm in less than three weeks in January totaled nearly $1.1 million.\nPlus, the state legislative committee probing the lane closures has been billed more than $200,000 by its counsel, Reid Schar, for his work in January alone.\nAt the Port Authority, officials on Wednesday said it is not yet possible to determine what the cost will be to the agency, which is supported largely by tolls on the Hudson River crossings.\n\u201cThis is an ongoing process and it will be impossible to predict the total cost at this time,\u201d said spokesman Steve Coleman.\nThe agency\u2019s executive director, Pat Foye, who has testified before a federal grand jury that is investigating the lane closures, confirmed during a news conference after the agency\u2019s monthly public meeting on Wednesday that his representation would be paid for by the agency.\nAs of two weeks ago, federal prosecutors had summoned up to a half-dozen Port Authority employees to testify or cooperate with their criminal probe, but their identities have remained a secret. An agency spokesman said later Wednesday that the agency would not identify the others who had made requests for indemnification.\nTwo Christie aides at the Port Authority who were involved in the September lane closures and also requested indemnification are not among those who are covered, the agency spokesman said. A request by David Wildstein, who ordered the September lane closures, was denied earlier this year. And agency officials have remained undecided on a request by former Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni, who had prior knowledge of the lane-closure plan.\nFoye had been scheduled to testify publicly next week before the New Jersey legislative committee that is investigating the lane closures. But federal prosecutors have requested that Foye\u2019s testimony before the panel be delayed, according to a source close to the investigation. Unlike federal prosecutors, the lawmaker panel does not have the authority to prosecute crimes, but, through its subpoena power, it has uncovered some of the most explosive information to surface publicly in the scandal.\nFoye and New Jersey Commissioner Pat Schuber have both received subpoenas to testify before the panel.\nUnder agency bylaws, the executive director must approve a request for indemnification after a determination by the agency\u2019s general counsel that an outside attorney is appropriate and necessary. Current and former employees and commissioners are eligible for indemnification if the actions that give rise to their legal assistance were within the scope of their job duties.\nIn this case, Foye\u2019s request was approved by Deputy Executive Director Deb Grammiccioni and General Counsel Darrell Buchbinder.\nThe New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office in April confirmed that five law firms had been retained by the state to represent employees. However, officials declined to release the names of the employees, citing attorney-client privilege.\nHowever, Bill Stepien, a former deputy chief of staff in Christie\u2019s office who left the state to work for the governor\u2019s reelection campaign, will be represented by the state-funded lawyers specifically for his time when he was deputy chief of staff and employed by the state and not for his later role as campaign manager, according to a letter from the Attorney General\u2019s Office to the firm.\nStepien is being represented by Kevin Marino, a partner at Marino, Tortorella & Boyle. Christie cut ties with Stepien after it became known that Stepien had knowledge about the lane closures.\nOther firms being paid by the state according to documents released in April include:\nIacullo Martino LLC, the representation for Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak.\nKrovatin, Klingeman LLC, who has Christina Genovese Renna as a client. Renna was Christie\u2019s director of intergovernmental affairs before resigning.\nRiker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti LLP, the representation for Evan Ridley, a Christie aide.\nRobert G. Stahl of Westfield was also listed as an attorney being paid for by the state, but his client is unknown.\nStaff Writer Michael Phillis contributed to this article. Email: boburg@northjersey.com\n"]]

This type of acne typically has larger than normal openings and are filled with a plug containing sebum (oil), keratin (protein), hair follicles and sloughed off skin cells.\nBlackheads are caused by excess production of sebum (oil), says Carroll. \"The usual cause of increased sebum production is hormone changes especially during puberty.\"  There are also special blackheads known as solar comedones, which are caused by chronic sun damage, Carroll explains.\n\"The black colour is caused by a chemical reaction known as oxidization,\" says Carroll.  \"When the melanin contained in the sebum is exposed to oxygen in the air it turns black.\"\nWhile blackheads can get better or worse, they are not infectious and thus do not spread.\n\"Cleansers with acids such as salicylic acid or glycloic acid can help dislodge the plug which will improve the blackheads,\" says Carroll.  Cleansing brushes and pore cleansing strips can also help clear skin and reduce blackheads.\nPrescription retinoid creams are best for eliminating existing blackheads.  In extreme cases an oral medication may be prescribed.  Carroll suggests using pore strips for temporary removal and microdermabrasion performed in a dermatologist's office.\nWith the regular use of cleansers containing salicylic acid as well as regular use of a retinoid cream, blackheads can be prevented, says Carroll.\nWhen it comes to healing scars, it really depends on the size, says Carroll. \"For an isolated scar I will often do a small excision. For multiple scars I turn to my lasers.\"  To prevent scarring all together, Carroll says you should avoid squeezing and frequently extracting them, as this can cause pores to become enlarged over time.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

Even if the thought of pouring water down your throat right away feels overwhelming, try it for four days in a row and see if you don't start doing it automatically after that.\nThere's are plenty of apps out there to keep track of your water intake, if you like that kind of reminder (Daily Water Free, picture here, is a favourite). But a another option is to set an alarm on your phone or calendar to remind you to drink every two hours or so.\nYes, that's right \u2014 your caffeinated (or decaf, if you're so inclined) morning beverage also has plenty of water in it, so you can include that in your count. According to WebMD, their diuretic effects do not take away from also hydrating you.\nThere's no science here, just pure superficiality that somehow still works. If you have a nicer water bottle, you may just be more inclined to use it. We love this Lifefactory glass option that holds one-quarter of your daily water intake in one go!\nThere are plenty of fruits and veggies that contain a fair amount of water, including cucumbers, iceberg lettuce, watermelon (obviously), strawberries, grapefruit, zucchini, radish and celery. Plus, of course, the many other nutrients this produce contains.\nWhen you're bogged down at work, even the 20-foot walk to the kitchen can feel too far, so set yourself up for the day with a big bottle \u2014 or even a pitcher \u2014 in the morning so you can dip into it all day.\nWe know, you've heard enough about \"infusing\" your water to last you a lifetime. But it really does make it taste better \u2014 and has the bonus effect of even more water, if you use some of those hydrating foods we mentioned. Some other good options: kiwi, lemon, strawberries or grapes.\nIt's so easy to make ice pops at home \u2014 all you need is a mold, some water, and the fruit of your choice. That way, you get to control what goes in it (i.e. the sugar), eat a delicious snack, and you're upping your water intake at the same time. Check out these recipes for homemade popsicles at Real Simple.\nNo one's expecting you to give up other drinks entirely in lieu of water, either sugar-filled or alcoholic. Instead, make yourself a deal \u2014 for every \"other\" kind of drink you have, drink a glass of water.\nIf you've gotten out of the habit of rinsing out your mouth after brushing your teeth, now's the time to start setting that glass by your sink again. A rinse, a refill, then a few gulps \u2014 and like that, you're hydrated before bed.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

Researchers concluded that they may only think about the positive, and not the negative outcomes of their actions.\nEleven Ways To Tell If Your Boss Is A Psychopath\nof\n\ue000\n\ue001\nPsychopaths are social chameleons and can change their psychological spots in the blink of an eye if they think they can benefit from doing so. Playing on sympathy is a favourite weapon of choice.   Make no mistake: psychopaths are confident, outgoing and mentally resilient, hardly ever, in reality, feeling sorry for themselves. But they are also master manipulators and have no qualms whatsoever about tugging on our emotional heartstrings if it works to their advantage.   Sympathy is a powerful motivator \u2013 a fact not lost on psychopaths even though they never feel it \u2013 and they are extremely adept at eliciting pity and compassion.   WARNING LIGHT: Consistently poor behaviour with frequent appeals to mitigating circumstances and pleas for support and understanding is one of the psychopath\u2019s most recognizable kitemarks \u2013 in both the corporate realm and that of everyday life.\nPsychopaths are emotional chess players and a psychopathic boss sees his employees merely as pieces on an invisible psychological chessboard: disposable, dispensable, superfluous.   Psychopaths love to pick people up, move people round, make people jump just for the sake of it - even if, sometimes, it\u2019s not to their immediate benefit. Unnecessary rearrangements of workspace, the sudden imposition of unsocial working hours, and the promise of favours for dishing the dirt on colleagues are just a few psychopathic favourites.   WARNING LIGHT: If you\u2019re left scratching your head on yet another occasion as you try to figure out the rationale for your boss\u2019s behaviour \u2013 then the answer might be simpler than you think.\nPsychopaths are past masters at making scintillating first impressions and possess an innate gift for making you feel as if you\u2019re the only person in the room.   They are brilliant psychologists. They know that, through evolution, our brains are programmed to put a lot of store in initial encounters and so they bank substantial emotional \u2018capital\u2019 early in a new relationship by turning on the charm.   One psychopath I interviewed put it like this: \u201cCharm is the ability to roll out a red carpet for those you cannot stand in order to fast-track them, as smoothly and efficiently as possible, in the direction you want them to go.\u201d   WARNING LIGHT: If you suddenly find that the red carpet is rolled up and that the charm fades quickly during subsequent meetings with your boss leaving you feeling confused and vulnerable, you may well have a psychopath on your hands.\nIrrespective of whether they play the charm, manipulation or sympathy cards, psychopaths are corporate vampires and are second to none in their ability to take you into their confidence and suck out valuable new ideas that may have been months in the planning.   A typical ploy is the use of reciprocity \u2013 a powerful tool of influence. A psychopath might open the bidding and \u2018confide\u2019 in you some low-level idea of his own in order that you follow suit with something better. Once in the psychopath\u2019s possession however, the idea is then \u2018confiscated\u2019 and, somewhere down the line, suddenly becomes \u2018theirs.\u2019   WARNING LIGHT: If your boss has a habit of taking the credit for work done by others, it might be time to look for work elsewhere.\nPsychopaths simply do not live by the same moral code as the rest of us, and experience little guilt or anxiety over telling lies \u2013 either to big themselves up, or to dump on others, or both.   In fact, it\u2019s their consummate lack of remorse for misrepresenting the facts that is the single biggest contributor to their inordinate capacity for fabrication. They appear plausible and reasonable and their webs of deceit frequently contain a modicum of truth which they rely on as a safety net should their spurious cover stories come under too close a scrutiny.   WARNING LIGHT: If your relationship with your boss has been plagued by \u2018misunderstandings\u2019 and \u2018false assumptions\u2019 it might be time to face the real truth.\nPsychopaths are completely driven by their own hard-nosed self-interest. Though they may feign concern for others, appearing warm, considerate and even helpful, such interest is shallow and superficial and merely serves as the foreplay for future exploitation. For psychopath, read \u201cps-I-chopath.\u201d   Psychopathic relationship patterns  - in both personal and corporate settings - are stormy and transient. \u201cFriendships\u201d are often terminated without warning, and ties mercilessly severed once an individual ceases to \u201cbe of any use.\u201d   Add to this an arrogant, grandiose and egocentric interpersonal style and you have on your hands a ruthless ambition machine with no \u201coff \u201cswitch.   WARNING LIGHT: If your boss has been known to fire people for no apparent reason, or has an ostentatious and extravagant profile out of keeping with a more objective assessment of their standing, or has a habit of stealing the limelight\u2026it\u2019s time to leave them to it.\nPsychopaths make expert defence attorneys and are supremely skilled at getting themselves off the hook should accusations of incompetence be leveled at them.   Not only do they never accept culpability, but they are also extremely adept at manufacturing evidence that lays the blame for their misdemeanours firmly at someone else\u2019s door.   Psychopathic bosses have no qualms whatsoever in using their employees as \u2018reputation shields\u2019 to safeguard their own status within the company.   WARNING LIGHT: If your boss has landed you in it through no fault of your own, start asking questions.\nThe brain of the psychopath is wired up in a different way to the rest of ours.   In particular, the part of the brain responsible for emotion \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 is turned down, meaning that psychopaths do not experience the everyday feelings of fear, regret and disgust so familiar to normal folk.   But that doesn\u2019t stop the psychopath acting scared, sorry or surprised in order to manipulate others. They are perfectly adept at putting on shows of emotion if it helps them get ahead.   A common example is extreme anger in response to a perceived personal insult, an alleged betrayal of trust, or the insufficient demonstration of respect for their authority. But such emotional pyrotechnics are purely for shock-and-awe purposes - coolly calculated psychological bombing raids aimed at minimizing the chances of any future \u201ctransgressions.\u201d   WARNING LIGHT: If your boss is prone to extreme displays of emotion then quickly returns to normal as if nothing has happened, you should start to question whether he really feels anything at all.\nImagine someone who has a warped perception of speed: someone who, through some weird trick of nature, perceives things happening at a much slower rate than they actually do.   You wouldn\u2019t want to get in a car with them, would you? Well, it\u2019s exactly the same with psychopaths \u2013 except for speed, read danger.   The neural power-cut in the fear zip code of psychopaths\u2019 brains means that things that would scare the hell out of the rest of us just don\u2019t have the same impact on these ice-cool emotional androids.   This, of course, gives psychopaths their enviable sang-froid, their composure under fire \u2013 and explains why they often do quite well for themselves in high-wire professions such as the media, finance and certain echelon areas of the military.   But it can, at times, also lead to unnecessary risk-taking \u2013 and, to return to the speed analogy, can often result in the car veering out of control and crashing off the road as opposed to a speedier journey time (as if we need any reminding with the global financial crisis.)   WARNING LIGHT: Risky investments, unwise alliances, inappropriate behaviour, risqu\u00e9 comments\u2026 if this sounds like your boss you may want to look for another one.\nPsychopaths are attracted to positions of influence in which they can satisfy their need to control and manipulate others.   Last year, I launched the Great British Psychopath Survey. The survey is unique: the first of its kind to assess the prevalence of psychopathic traits within an entire national workforce. What would turn out to be the UK\u2019s most psychopathic profession? I wondered.   The results made interesting reading. CEOs, media folk, lawyers, surgeons, police officers, the clergy\u2026any line of work which boasts a definitive hierarchical infrastructure and affords a position of power over others which may be wielded with relative impunity is ideally suited to the psychopathic personality.   WARNING LIGHT: If your boss has a tendency to step on those beneath him but goes out of his way to impress those above him, it\u2019s time to move sideways\u2026to another department or company.\nHollywood movies typically portray the psychopath as an intense, menacing figure who makes the hairs on the back of one\u2019s neck stand on end \u2013 and there\u2019s evidence to suggest this is true.   Psychopaths often do give out a certain \u2018aura\u2019 and folk sometimes report experiencing unnerving physical sensations in their presence such as \u201che sends a chill up my spine\u201d and \u201che makes my skin crawl.\u201d   WARNING LIGHT: If you sometimes feel uneasy around your boss, and are uncomfortable being on your own with him for any length of time, trust your gut instinct: GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

The applicant proposed 53 parking spots at the new site, while 55 are required under zoning regulations. The existing property only has 24 parking spaces, but was able to supplement its\u00a0parking through an agreement with the church across the street.\nOriginally, the applicant proposed that as many as 190 students be enrolled at Primrose. But\u00a0after much\u00a0back-and-forth between the applicant and the board, one of several conditions\u00a0for approval\u00a0included dropping the student count to 160. By the Thursday hearing, the applicant had already dropped the number to 168 students by reducing the square footage of the property, thus shrinking the number of parking spaces required by statute. Other conditions included not allowing certain activities to take place on-site, such as graduations, since they draw more people who might park on residential streets.\nThe site plan for the Primrose School on Paramus Road on display during Thursday night's Board of Adjustment hearing.\n\u00a0(Photo: Melanie Anzidei/NorthJersey.com)\nRaghav \u201cRocco\u201d Varma, the owner of the property and\u00a0of\u00a0Primrose School of Florham Park, said the school would be one of his smaller operations. Most average about 190 students, as originally proposed, he said.\nPrimrose School is a national chain of accredited private preschools. According to its website, there are five Primrose locations in New Jersey. In addition to its future Paramus location, the company also anticipates two more openings in the future, including one in Wayne.\nMore than a dozen residents attended the Thursday night hearing.\nHalf\u00a0those residents, when testifying before the board,\u00a0cited concerns such as increased noise from children at the school, limited buffers between their backyards and the new development, and traffic that could trickle onto their already-crowded\u00a0streets.\u00a0The board proposed an 8-foot\u00a0vinyl\u00a0fence between the facility and abutting properties as another condition of approval.\nMany residents also expressed concerns that the facility would increase traffic at an already-congested section of Paramus Road.\n\"I grew up in the neighborhood. I've been living there constantly for the last 20 years,\" said Bill Doukas, who lives on Seneca Court. \"There's times literally, if I want to pull out of Seneca Court to go north on Paramus Road \u2013 you can't do it. There's no break in traffic. I end up pulling out to the right.\"\nAlampi, however, said that \"a percentage\" of people who would be driving into the facility would already be driving on Paramus Road.\n\"This is not a traffic generator. This is not a supermarket that is drawing people that wouldn't already otherwise be there,\" Alampi said during the hearing. \"There are people who are going to travel this road\u00a0past the site, and go to another day care as they drop their kid off and go to work.

In February 2014, she was fired from her job at MHPM Project Leaders for performance issues.\nAdjudicator Jennifer Scott ruled in her favour on March 14, defining miscarriage as a disability and thus allowing Mou to move forward with a wrongful termination suit against her former employer.\n\"I also find the applicant\u2019s miscarriage is a disability,\" Scott wrote in her decision. \"It also is not a common ailment, and it is certainly not transitory.

While it\u2019s unfortunate that miscarriage is so common, your friend can take comfort in not being alone. Knowing that others in their own network of friends have experienced the same thing makes it easier to work through the grieving process.\nThere\u2019s no better time for your friend to focus on taking care of themselves. A restful body will help to heal the mind. Gift your friend with a massage or a pedicure so she is forced to take time out to enjoy a little pampering. And if you can, join her!\nUnfortunately, there isn\u2019t really anything you can do to reassure your friend that they\u2019ll feel better in a few weeks or months. It\u2019s a grieving process \u2013- one that affects everyone differently. All that you can do is lend an ear, hold a hand and wait it out with them.\nWhile you may be wondering what the doctors discovered or if your friend is going to try again -- wait for your friend to share those details with you. Don\u2019t try to pry it out of her. She might not be ready to discuss the details with you yet, but if you let her know that you\u2019re there for her and available if she wants to talk, then she will come to you when she's ready.\n10 Fertility Facts You May Not Know\n1. Your fertility is mostly determined by genetics, which influences how many eggs you are born with.   Doctors believe that the number of eggs you have at birth determines the length of time you will remain fertile. At birth, women have about two million eggs in their ovaries. For every egg ovulated during your reproductive life, about 1,000 eggs undergo programmed cell death. Other things, such as smoking cigarettes and certain types of chemotherapy, can accelerate egg cell death and promote an earlier menopause.\n2. Regular menstrual cycles are a sign of regular ovulation.  Most women have regular cycles lasting between 24 and 35 days. This is usually a sign of regular, predictable ovulation. Women who do not ovulate regularly have irregular menstrual cycles. Those who do not ovulate at all may have a genetic condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n3. Basal temperature charting does not predict ovulation.  An older method of tracking ovulation involves taking your oral body temperature each morning before getting out of bed. This is called basal body temperature. This method is used to spot a rise in basal temperature, which is a sign that progesterone is being produced.   The main problem with using this method is that your temperature rises after ovulation has already occurred. This makes it more difficult to time intercourse at an optimal time for conception.   A better method is to use over-the-counter urine ovulation predictor test kits such as Clearblue Easy. These kits test for the hormone that prompts ovulation, which is called luteinizing hormone (LH).\n4. Most women with blocked fallopian tubes are completely unaware they may have had a prior pelvic infection.  About 10 percent of infertility cases are due to tubal disease, either complete blockage or pelvic scarring causing tubal malfunction. One major cause of tubal disease is a prior pelvic infection from a sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia. These infections can cause so few symptoms that you may be completely unaware your tubes are affected.   This is why fertility physicians will order a dye test of the tubes, called a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), if you have been trying and failing to conceive for 6 months or longer.\n5. In most cases, stress does not cause infertility.   Except in rare cases of extreme physical or emotional distress, women will keep ovulating regularly. Conceiving while on vacation is likely less about relaxation than about coincidence and good timing of sex.\n6. By age 44, most women are infertile, even if they are still ovulating regularly.   Even with significant fertility treatment, rates of conception are very low after age 43. Most women who conceive in their mid-40's with fertility treatment are using donated eggs from younger women.\n7. Having fathered a pregnancy in the past does not guarantee fertility.   Sperm counts can change quite a bit with time, so never assume that a prior pregnancy guarantees fertile sperm. Obtaining a semen analysis is the only way to be sure the sperm are still healthy!\n8. For the most part, diet has little or nothing to do with fertility.   Despite popular press, there is little scientific data showing that a particular diet or food promotes fertility. One limited study did suggest a Mediterranean diet with olive oil, fish and legumes may help promote fertility.\n9. Vitamin D may improve results of fertility treatments.   A recent study from the University of Southern California suggested that women who were undergoing fertility treatments, but had low vitamin D levels, might have lower rates of conception. This vitamin is also essential during pregnancy. At Pacific Fertility Center, we recommend our patients take 2,000-4,000 IU per day.\n10. Being either underweight or overweight is clearly linked with lowered levels of fertility.   The evidence in recent years is that obesity is clearly linked with a longer time to conception. Having a body mass index less than 18 or over 32 is associated with problems ovulating and conceiving, as well as problems during pregnancy.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

If you don't remember, chances are you're not alone.\nIf you aren't cleaning out that tiny crevice on a regular basis, you may want to reconsider. In the video above, Dr. Travis Stork of The Doctors explains the average belly button is home to more than 60 different types of bacteria in addition to lotions, dirt, sweat and soap.\nBelly button dirt can actually build up so much, people have mistaken it for skin cancer, dermatologist Alexandria V. Booth explained to Women's Health.\nIn the slideshow below, we reveal 10  fascinating facts about your belly button, from how it's formed to the infections you can get and most importantly, how to keep it squeaky clean.\nClose\n10 Facts About Your Belly Button\nof\n\ue000\n\ue001\nDr. Curtis Cetrulo Jr. tells NBC News, your belly button is created by the way the umbilical cord is cut at birth. He notes it gets its appearance from the way the cord dries up and falls off.\nAccording to researchers at North Carolina State University, the average belly button is home to 67 different types of bacteria.\nYep, in 2013 biologist Christina Agapakis teamed up with odour artist Sissel Tolaas to make craft cheese from bacteria found on the human body, Wired reported. But we suggest just buying your block of cheese from the local grocery store.\nBelly button yeast infections can affect both genders at any age. According to Livestrong, newborns can develop infections from a mother's yeast infection during childbirth.   Symptoms of belly button yeast infections include itching, redness and odour. If you notice discharge or if you feel pain, nausea or a fever, contact your doctor immediately.\nUnlike your ears, which are self-cleaning, your belly button needs a little help to stay clean. Use cotton swabs and a bit of rubbing alcohol to wipe away the dirt hiding inside your navel. Alcohol should be used sparingly however, as it may dry out the area. Regular soap and water should do the trick on a daily basis.\nThe lower abdomen is a very sensitive area for both men and women, and the belly button is a major part of that area. According to Intimate Medicine, stimulation of the belly button can result in a tingling sensation on the clitoris for women and on the penis for men.\nBut not all. According to researchers in Singapore, small, oval shaped navels with a ratio of 46:54 and a \"hood\" are the prettiest.\nThough it is uncommon, some people don't have belly buttons as a result of umbilical hernias and gastroschisis being born with their stomach and intestines poking through a small hole in the abdominal wall, reports BBC News. Model Karolina Kurkova lost her belly button to this type of condition and surgery as a child.\nResearchers in Australia found over weight men with body hair on their stomach were more likely to develop belly button lint, because the hair on their stomach tends to rub against clothing fibres creating and trapping lint.\nDuring pregnancy, a growing belly can actually pop out an \"innie\", Dr. Karen Marie Jaffe tells Everyday Health. After childbirth, the belly button tends to return to its normal shape.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

Fights To Beat The Odds\nPosted:\nWhen Quinn was born in January, she seemed like a perfectly healthy baby.\nBut when she was a few weeks old, she caught a cold and didn't recover.\nParents Robert Shirley and Dawn Roberts took Quinn to the hospital in their hometown of Victoria, B.C. There, the baby was subject to a slew of tests.\n\"Our doctor at the time had this funny feeling, thinking something wasn't right with her,\" Robert said.\nQuinn and her mom, Dawn Roberts. (Photo: Robert Shirley)\nBlood tests helped doctors figure out that Quinn had a rare genetic disorder called adenosine deaminase\u2013deficient severe combined immunodeficiency , known as ADA-SCID, or SCID.\nBecause of the condition, Quinn's immune system doesn't work as it should. Any infection \u2014 be it a serious virus or a bout with the common cold \u2014 could kill her.\nQuinn. (Photo: Robert Shirley)\n\"She produces all the white blood cells she needs to fight infection, but when her body reproduces those cells, the old cells that her body leaves behind aren't being filtered out,\" Robert explained in an interview with The Huffington Post B.C. \"So when those old cells break down, they produce a toxin that's killing some of her new white blood cells that she needs.\n\"As soon as you get exposed to germs, [patients] don't have the immune system to fight it off. Her body doesn't react to seeing a cold \u2014 it'll just let the virus do its thing. She won't get fevers or anything like that,\" he added.\n\"Babies that have SCID, a lot of them don't make it to the hospital because parents just don't know they're sick,\" Dawn added. \"So it was actually a blessing that she happened to catch that bug.\"\n'Bubble babies'\nNo SCID case is better known than David Vetter's. Born in Houston in 1971, Vetter spent his entire life \u2014 save two weeks \u2014 inside what was essentially a big, plastic balloon.\nIt was a sterile space that acted as a barrier between life and death.\nHe became known as \"the boy in the bubble,\" living inside the plastic walls until he died at the age of 12 .\nVetter was a phenomenon, because back then, babies with SCID just didn't live as long as he had.\nMost didn't even come close.\nNowadays, children like Quinn \u2014 commonly known as \"bubble babies\" \u2014 have treatment options.\nThe first is a bone marrow transplant. Robert and Dawn are testing to see if they're a match, although it's not likely. A sibling would be a better candidate, but Quinn doesn't have any.\nThe second option, if a transplant is ruled out, would be an experimental gene therapy treatment available at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA).\nDoctors would extract one of Quinn's defective cells, repair it, and then put it back in the baby's body . That cell would then reproduce, slowly building a functioning immune system.\nIf successful, Robert and Dawn say Quinn would have a chance at a \"normal\" life.\n\"We've have an amazing medical team working with us to get Quinn and get her on the right path,\" Robert said.\nNewborn Quinn with her parents before being diagnosed with ADA-SCIDS. (Photo: Painted Barn Photography)\nAs of November 2014, 18 children with SCID had been cured through treatment at UCLA.\nOne Toronto boy that underwent the procedure is \"well on his way\" to recovery, and Dawn said she's in touch with his mom to chat about what happens next.\nDoctors from Vancouver General Hospital have applied to see whether Quinn is eligible for the treatment, but haven't heard back.\nCostly cures\nQuinn's parents face heavy costs, no matter which route they take.\nIf the baby undergoes a bone marrow transplant, Dawn and Robert will have to cover the cost of living in Vancouver, prepping their home for long-term recovery, and their daughter's post-op medication.\nIf they go for gene therapy, the family will likely have to cover travel costs to California. On top of that, it's not clear whether the experimental U.S. treatment will be covered by B.C.'s Medical Services Plan.\nRobert and Dawn say they're not sure how much they'll have to shell out for treatment at UCLA, but they're certain it won't be cheap.\nWith both options, the couple would leave their jobs to care for Quinn in her own \"bubble\" while she recovers.\nThe process could take several years.\n\"It\u2019s been quite a process ... But we\u2019re willing to do anything to keep her healthy.\"\nIn March, Quinn's extended family launched a GoFundMe campaign to pay for the anticipated bills.\nThey've raised nearly $20,000 \u2014 a number Dawn said is overwhelming.\nQuinn is currently in hospital, fighting off an unrelated problem with her bowels. When she's able to eat properly again, her parents will be able to bring her home while they wait for a decision on a treatment for her condition.\nWhile they wait, the family will have strict rules to follow.\nRobert Shirley, Dawn Roberts, and baby Quinn. (Photo: Robert Shirley)\n\"We'll be sent home to live in isolation,\" Dawn said. \"No visitors ... our dog won't be allowed in the same room ... and I'm not able to breastfeed, because I could catch a cold and pass it onto her.\"\n\"It's been quite a process ... But we're willing to do anything to keep her healthy,\" the first-time mom added.\n\"What we just have to do is stay positive for Quinn. She's been extremely strong, and she's been through a lot for only two months on the planet.\"\n"]]

(Photo: Zhang Peng/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nThe alert comes amid concerns about low vaccination rates throughout the Vancouver area.\nLast year, CBC News compiled VCH data to look at which schools throughout the region fell below the 95 per cent herd immunity rate for measles shots.\nThe Vancouver Waldorf School in North Vancouver, for example, only had a measles vaccination rate of 27 per cent, while Grandview Elementary School in East Vancouver had a vaccination rate of 47 per cent.\nThe provincial government last year sent out a mailing reminding parents to have their children vaccinated.\n\"Not immunizing children puts all of us at risk\" the letter said.\nEverything You Need To Know About Measles\nof\n\ue000\n\ue001\nThe measles, also known as rubeola, is spread through coughing, sneezing\u00a0and breathing. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes\u00a0and sore throat. This is then followed by a red, blotchy skin rash.\u00a0\nAlthough the measles are highly contagious, they are not common in Canada and the U.S., which is why the recent outbreak is so worrisome. Today, the measles are common in Europe, Asia, Africa\u00a0and the Pacific. The virus spreads when infected people travel abroad.\u00a0\nIf your child\u2019s fever lasts for at least three days and they have a cough, catarrh (nose and air passages are filled with mucus), or conjunctivitis (pink eye), then they likely have the measles.  Tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth, known as Koplik spots, will also appear, usually two days before the measles rash occurs.\u00a0\nThis is because the measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and death. According to Mayo Clinic, the measles kills more than 100,000 people a year, most are under the age of five.\u00a0\nThere is no specific treatment for the measles because it\u2019s caused by a virus. When someone is infected with the measles, their symptoms don\u2019t show until 10 to 14 days after exposure.  The infected individual is then kept isolated and treated for things like lack of vitamin A, protein deficiencies, respiratory tract infections, eye-related complications\u00a0and dehydration through diarrhea.  Most people will recover from the measles within two to three weeks. However, between five and 20 per cent of people who contract the disease die from complications.\u00a0\nThe measles vaccine is known as the MMR shot (measles-mumps-rubella) or the MMRV shot (measles-mumps-rubella-varicella). Two doses of the vaccine can protect you for life as the first has 85 to 95 per cent efficacy and the second is almost 100 per cent.\u00a0\nThe second shot is then given between the ages of four and six.\u00a0\nThis is because pregnancy changes your immune system. Thus, pregnant women who have not yet received the vaccine should wait until after they give birth.\nInfectious disease specialist Dr. Michael Gardam recommends receiving the second vaccination within 72 hours of exposure to the virus. \u201cIt is really incredibly contagious and it's spread through the airborne route,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I don't have to touch you, or come even close to you -- if you're breathing the air that I just exhaled, you can get infected.\"\nSo far there have been six confirmed cases of the measles in Toronto -- four adults and two kids under the age of two.  Thankfully, this is significantly lower than last year\u2019s outbreak in British Columbia, where 433 cases were reported.\u00a0 Additionally, there is one case of the measles in the Niagara region. The infected individual is an unvaccinated,\u00a0female adult who had recently visited Toronto.\u00a0 One case has been reported in Manitoba.\n\ue002 Share\n"]]

The legislative committee, which does not have the power to level criminal charges, agreed late last month to push back Foye\u2019s appearance until June and said that he had a \u201cscheduling conflict.\u201d\nBoth sources requested anonymity because they are not authorized to publicly discuss the grand jury proceedings.\nOne of the sources said Foye testified before the grand jury early this month, but details about that testimony were not available. Foye declined to comment on Friday.\nFoye is among up to a half-dozen current Port Authority officials who have been summoned by federal prosecutors from the office of New Jersey\u2019s U.S. Attorney, Paul Fishman, suggesting that the pace of the investigation has quickened in recent weeks.\nOne of the employees called to testify is Arielle Schwarz, who was a special assistant to David Wildstein, the former Port Authority executive and onetime ally of Governor Christie who oversaw the lane closures, two sources said. Phillip Kwon, the agency\u2019s first deputy general counsel, has also been subpoenaed, although it is unclear if he has testified.\nJust because a grand jury is hearing testimony about the lane closures does not mean federal prosecutors will charge anyone with a crime. But its sustained focus on the closings suggests that prosecutors have cleared a preliminary investigative hurdle \u2014 identifying a federal law that may have been broken when two of three local lanes were shut, possibly for political reasons, creating massive traffic jams in Fort Lee for parts of five days.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t comment on grand jury matters,\u201d said Rebekah Carmichael of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New Jersey.\nFoye, the top executive at the Port Authority, has said he was not notified that the access lanes would be closed and found out four days later. On the morning of Sept. 13, he reopened the lanes and sent an angry email calling the decision to shut them \u201cabusive,\u201d adding that he believed state and federal laws had been broken. The controversy that followed has hurt Christie\u2019s standing as an early front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination leading up to the 2016 election.\nWeeks before the lane closures, a deputy chief of staff in Christie\u2019s office, Bridget Anne Kelly, sent Wildstein an email, \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d The two also exchanged derisive messages about Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who did not endorse Christie for reelection. Christie fired Kelly a day after The Record broke the story about the email and has insisted he had no prior knowledge or involvement in planning or authorizing the closures.\nChristie\u2019s chief spokesman, Michael Drewniak, also testified before the grand jury last month and appeared before the legislative panel this week.\nOn Friday, a left-leaning political action committee released more than 1,000 pages of documents that it had requested from the Port Authority. The records provide a rough outline of former Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni\u2019s activities leading up to and after the lane closings.\nBaroni, a former Republican state senator, was appointed by Christie to be New Jersey\u2019s top executive at the agency. He resigned in December, weeks after he told state lawmakers that the lane closures were the result of a traffic study, an account that has since been undermined.\nThe records show that Baroni scheduled two meetings with Sokolich in the mayor\u2019s Fort Lee office in December 2012 and April 2013, during the height of the Christie administration\u2019s alleged attempts to woo Sokolich and other Democrats for an endorsement.\nIn January, Sokolich\u2019s name appeared on a list of 21 Democratic mayors the Christie campaign had targeted, according to a report issued in March by the law firm Christie hired to look into his office\u2019s role in the lane closures. Sokolich ultimately declined to endorse the governor.\nThe documents include two years of daily calendar entries and several expense records and were released in response to a public records request filed by American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC that conducts opposition research to aid Democratic candidates and causes.\nBaroni did not respond to messages Friday. A person who answered the phone at Sokolich\u2019s law firm said he was unavailable.\nThe calendar entries also show Baroni had scheduled meetings with two other figures who have emerged in connection to the lane-closure scandal but whose roles remain unexplained.\nBaroni\u2019s schedule indicates he planned to meet with Rabbi Mendy Carlebach in July, August and October 2013.\nThose meetings coincide with the period that Carlebach, a Port Authority police chaplain, allegedly upset Wildstein, his colleague and adviser. Wildstein wrote that Carlebach had \u201cpissed me off,\u201d in a text message with Kelly in August, and Wildstein and Kelly exchanged jokes about causing traffic jams in front of Carlebach\u2019s house and orchestrating delays for flights to Tel Aviv.\nCarlebach has said he had never spoken to Wildstein and only exchanged pleasantries with Kelly.\nThe records show that Baroni also scheduled a meeting in February 2013 in his office with lobbyist Jeff Michaels and representatives of the security firm Allied Barton, five months before the Port Authority secured a four-year, $221 million contract with the company for guards at its airports.\nMichaels\u2019 brother, Chip, is the Port Authority police officer who escorted Wildstein on a tour of the traffic tie-ups in September. The Michaels brothers, Wildstein and Christie grew up together in Livingston.\nEmail: boburg@northjersey.com and akin@northjersey.com\n"]]

From 2011 to 2015, driver inattention contributed to 875 fatal crashes \u2013 more than drunken driving (506), speeding (451) and pedestrian violations (605), according to State Police figures.\nBut can a two- to three-week crackdown really hold back the tidal wave of perilous in-car activities that have become second nature to thousands of motorists who read, eat, drink, groom themselves\u00a0and use hand-held devices to either talk, text or find their way?\nMaybe so. After all, the fine for a first offense is now $200 to $400. But let\u2019s first examine last year\u2019s crackdown.\nA total of 355 police departments participated, but they issued fewer than 7,000 distracted-driving summonses. (Speeding netted more citations \u2013 8,000.) And the campaign seemed to lack\u00a0follow-through:\u00a0By year\u2019s end, statewide\u00a0summonses for violations of\u00a0NJSA 39:4-97.3\u00a0had slipped to 55,832 \u2013 17 percent fewer than in 2015, according to court records.\nBut this year will be different, promised Poedubicky.\nHis reasoning hinges on funding. Last year\u2019s campaign -- called \"U Drive U Text U Pay\" -- lacked\u00a0a federal grant. So traffic cops simply squeezed distracted drivers\u00a0into their daily routines.\u00a0But this year, police in New Jersey, Connecticut and Maine \u2013 the only states to receive federal grants \u2013 will be paid time-and-a-half to focus\u00a0on the drivers\u00a0who cause 25 percent of all serious crashes, according to federal authorities.\nThis plan matches similar crackdowns for seat-belt and drunken-driving violations.\nSome\u00a0believe this approach is less than serious. It\u2019s \u201crent-a-cop,\u201d said Ramsey motorist J.P. Tristani, who called the system \u201covertime pay for junior officers not yet at the maximum\u201d just so they can \"increase yearly pay.\u201d\nBut as one lawmaker noted, few strategies are as effective as enforcement.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the shock of a ticket to send a message to people who are tempted to reach for a phone,\u201d said Assemblyman Declan O\u2019Scanlon, a Monmouth County Republican. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all tempted, so we all need enforcement.\u201d\nTraffic enforcement and road maintenance declined during and after the Great Recession. But road crashes, injuries and deaths plummeted anyway as technology improved driving safety and motorists cut back on expenses by driving less. In 2008 alone, statewide traffic deaths fell 18.5 percent, from 724 to 590.\nBut since then,\u00a0fatal\u00a0crashes in some\u00a0categories continued to climb. Deadly distracted-driving crashes\u00a0during\u00a0the 2011-to-2015 period exceeded the\u00a0previous five-year total by nearly 9\u00a0percent. Fatal\u00a0pedestrian crashes for the same period rose\u00a0nearly 4 percent.\u00a0Statistically, young people remained as vulnerable to road carnage as they were to deadly drug abuse, an issue that generally garners much more attention.\u00a0In 2015, for example, New Jersey road crashes killed 56 people under the age of 21, exactly the same number of New Jersey deaths attributed to drug overdoses in the same age cohort, according to National Safety Council figures.\nIn an\u00a0informal poll last week, readers said they welcomed more police presence. After years of stomach-churning excursions on highways like 17, 23, 46, 208 and 287, for example, my lawyer pal Grumpy John\u00a0proclaimed that he welcomed a return to \u201cthe era of Broderick Crawford,\u201d who played a grumpy police chief in the 1950s TV series \u201cHighway Patrol.\u201d\n\u201cHe and his men actually ventured onto highways,\u201d Grumpy recalled. \u201cIf police did that here, their mere presence would have a calming effect on traffic.\u201d\nThe timing seems ripe for this approach because increased fatalities are no longer confined to a few categories. Besides last year\u2019s spike to 607, overall\u00a0road deaths also rose in the two previous years from a base of 542 in 2013. If you ask the bean counters in the State Police Fatal\u00a0Accident Investigative Unit for the last time fatalities shot up three years in a row, they can\u2019t answer because there\u2019s no precedent since they began keeping track in 1968.\nSo we\u2019ve lived through what statisticians consider a bona fide three-year trend. How can we keep it from infecting 2017?\nWhen asked, readers came up with much more than a cellphone crackdown.\nAlan Appel wants periodic vision testing. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit harsh,\u201d said the Mahwah motorist, \u201cbut it has to happen.\u201d Alan might know something; he\u2019s 77.\nKate Wade wants a crackdown on drivers and pedestrians who wear headphones. \u201cHow can they hear a horn or siren?\u201d asked the Leonia reader.\nCiting too-frequent crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists after dark, Carol Lotito wants free distribution of reflective bracelets and shoe bands. \u201cThank God I haven\u2019t hit somebody at night,\u201d said the Cresskill motorist.\nRutherford\u2019s Tony Sobieski wants a resumption of auto-safety inspections, which were halted in 2010.\u00a0Walter Thomassen of Fair Lawn wants the street lights and the electronic speed indicator restored at the dangerous \u201ctanker turn\u201d where routes 95 and 80 meet in Ridgefield. Bob Green of Ho-Ho-Kus thinks police should ticket fellow cops.\nUnrealistic? Maybe so, but the state itself adopted a Vision Zero road-safety goal that might seem unrealistic, too. Its Division of Highway Traffic Safety pledged to reduce traffic deaths to zero by 2030. The pledge was made in 2015 based on the previous year\u2019s death toll of 556. But now that deaths have reached 607, all New Jerseyans have plenty of catching up to do.\nWe could start by putting down our phones in the car.\n46 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2ivyvil\n"]]

But fresh fruit and vegetables showed some of the biggest increases, shooting up 12.9 and 18.2 per cent respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, Loblaw's internal food inflation outpaced the CPI's 4.1 per cent jump, according to the company's financial reports.\nAnd while it has managed to pass most of this cost on to the consumer, shoppers started choosing cheaper products when some foods surpassed a certain price point, president and executive chairman Galen Weston said during a conference call with investors last week.\nConsumers, especially those in Alberta where the economy is struggling, have flocked to Loblaw's discount offerings, he said.\nBranson said Loblaw looks to deliver great value regardless of the economy, but thinks that with the way things are now the offerings may be benefiting Canadians more than when Naturally Imperfect was first launched.\nIt plans to expand the program even more over the coming months.\nFollow @AleksSagan on Twitter.\n"]]

Woodland Park did not renew its contract with Constellation Energy this year because its rates were not 5 percent lower than PSE&G's.\n(Photo: Lindsey Kelleher)\nWOODLAND PARK \u2014 The borough did not renew its contract with a third-party energy supplier that assured residents last year that they would save money on their electric bills.\nThe contract between Constellation Energy Services and the municipality expired in December, and now that the contract is up, Public Service Electric & Gas will go back to charging residents for the supply portion of their electric bills. PSE&G is the primary electric service provider for Woodland Park.\nVerizon pushed to extend FiOS service in Woodland Park\nThe borough entered into a contract with Constellation Energy last winter in an effort to provide residents with some savings. Constellation offered residents a flat, fixed rate for their energy supply.\nUnder the contract, residents were expected to pay 5 percent less for the supply portion of their electric bills compared to what PSE&G would have charged them, according to Borough Clerk Kevin Galland. Regardless of supplier, PSE&G still is responsible for the delivery of energy to homes, billing and administrative functions.\nHowever, when bid prices for energy suppliers came back this past fall, the prices were higher than what PSE&G was willing to provide, Galland said.\nAs a result, the borough defaulted back to PSE&G.\nWhether or not the borough will enter into a contract with a third-party supplier in the future, Galland said, \u201cWhen the opportunity is presented to the governing body, it will weigh the pros and cons of going into a contract and make its decision based on the pros and cons.\u201d\nWoodland Park entered into the contract with Constellation Energy last year because the municipality was participating in an energy aggregation program called the Passaic County Energy Cooperative Pricing System.\nThe Passaic County Energy Cooperative Pricing System was formed in 2010 to offer joint purchasing opportunities for energy suppliers that would provide counties and municipalities with energy savings and to help taxpayers save money on their electric bills.\nEmail: kelleher@northjersey.com\n21 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jJ9nCC\n"]]

(Photo: Dennis Van Tine/Star Max/IPx)\nThe ad posted Monday cites the case of a woman who has been taking a brand name medication since the 1980s that, at one time,\u00a0it says cost about $180 for 10 shots.\nThe name of the medication is not disclosed in the ad, which\u00a0appears to have been filmed at a town hall-type campaign stop in January.\nThe ad shows Clinton waving a letter\u00a0and saying the cost of the woman's\u00a0latest refill\u00a0has shot up to $14,700 for the same 10 vials.\n\"The company is called Valeant Pharmaceuticals. I am going after them,\" Clinton tells the meeting to a round of applause.\n\"This is\u00a0predatory pricing and we're going to make sure it is stopped.\"\nMichael Pearson, chairman and chief executive officer of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., speaks during an interview at the Bloomberg Canada Economic Summit in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on Thursday, May 21, 2015.\nValeant said after it became aware of the patient's story in January, it contacted her to determine whether it could help cover the costs of the medication as part of a patient assistance program.\n\"She informed us that her insurance provider covers the drug, so it is not a significant out-of-pocket expenditure for her,\" Valeant said in a statement Tuesday.\nValeant also said there has been a generic version of the drug available since 2003 and that its share of the overall market for the medication has declined to less than one per cent.\n\"Whenever the sales volume of a drug declines, manufacturers must consider pricing adjustments to keep production of the drug viable,\" Valeant said. \"Patients are able to choose generic versions of the drug, however, at significantly lower prices.\"\nThe company, one of\u00a0several companies under investigation as the U.S. Congress looks at price increases for certain specialty drugs, has seen its share price plummet to well under $100 from above $346 last summer.

The street was chosen through a traffic study conducted by\u00a0Neglia\u00a0Engineering.\u00a0Township officials must demonstrate a need for the grant. If selected, the award would be determined later.\nAn aerial view of the proposed project area for the Safe Routes To School project.\n\u00a0(Photo: Neglia Engineering Associates)\nThe other grant, which\u00a0officials\u00a0applied for in June, is the\u00a0federal\u00a0Safe Routes\u00a0To\u00a0School grant, which\u00a0encourages municipalities to create safer and more accessible paths to school for students walking and biking\u00a0by providing funding for sidewalks.\nThe\u00a0proposed project area extends from East Grove Street to Hoffmann Street and would comprise sidewalk construction, creation of pedestrian walkways and intersection safety improvements.\u00a0The total project would cost $417,390\u00a0of which the grant could cover\u00a0\u00a0$347, 825.\u00a0Township officials would likely make up the difference by\u00a0borrowing\u00a0the money by issuing municipal bonds, officials said.\nTownship officials applied for two reasons:\u00a0to double the number of students walking to and from school from 75 to 150 per day and to make their walks safer, according to the application.\u00a0If the grant is awarded and the project completed, an estimated 60 percent of all Memorial School students would be walking to and from school.\n\"We feel it\u2019s a needed project,\"\u00a0Brugger\u00a0said. \"It\u2019s a well qualified project under what this grant affords.\"\nBoth\u00a0grants have\u00a0yet to be awarded. The Safe Routes To School grant response is expected sometime in February. For the DOT grant,\u00a0the final amount to be requested\u00a0is dependent on if it is awarded or not.\nEmail: torrejon@northjersey.com\u00a0\nLeuning Street in South Hackensack is in need of repairs.\n\u00a0(Photo: Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com)\n"]]

Building pictured Jan. 7, 2017.\n(Photo: Adam Anik/NorthJersey.com)\nWill an empty office building in Parsippany be converted into residential apartments and retail space?\nIt's hard to tell since township officials won't confirm or deny that talks have taken place with representatives of a business complex off Route 202. The plan, according to some, is\u00a0to turn one of the\u00a0Campus Drive Mack-Cali building into 97 apartment units and store-fronts at the main level.\nCarlos Guzman, president of the 300-member Sedgefield Civic Association said he was told by Mayor James Barberio of the plan in September. He said the mayor didn't specify which Mack-Cali building would be used, but did say the talk left him worried that such a deal would worsen traffic in an already congested area.\nThe mayor has not returned repeated calls and emails seeking information.\n\u201cThe mayor told me that Mack-Cali was planning to put in one building of about 97 apartments with high-end retail stores,\u201d said Guzman.\nParsippany business gets EPA kudos for recycling\nGuzman shared the information with Brian Tappen, who heads the 300-member Glacier Hills neighborhood association. Tappen said he reached out to the mayor and said he was told town officials \u201cwere in confidential talks with Mack-Cali.\u201d Tappen said the mayor wouldn't say more, but added if \"anything happened\" that would affect the neighborhood associations they would be notified.\nTappen said he believes the plan is also to make the apartments fit the affordable housing requirement, but has not been able to confirm that information.\nIlene Jablonski, senior vice president of Marketing for Mack-Cali said:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re currently looking at best uses for our assets in Parsippany.\u201d\nThe building at the center of the discussions sits near Glacial Hills and the Sedgefield homes near routes 10, 202 and 53. It\u2019s already a busy traffic area with backups during commuting times, said Tappen.\n\u201cThere is already a traffic problem caused by people cutting from Route 202 to Route 53,\u201d Tappen said. \u201cIf this apartment complex is built it will be a thousand times worse.\u201d\nTappen asked the township for more information regarding the possible project, when he was denied he filed for the information through the Open Public Records Act in early November 2016. On Friday, after a number of requested extensions, the township emailed two documents to Tappen containing hundreds of pages of old emails, some dating back to 2012, between township and Mack-Cali officials, nothing pertaining to residential housing at Campus Drive. Tappen said the information he received is incomplete and said he is being kept out of the loop.\nCouncilmen Robert Peluso and Paul Carifi Jr. said they, too, often feel out of the loop.\n\u201c\"I can\u2019t discuss items from closed sessions unless approved by township attorney.\"\u201d\nRobert Peluso, Parsippany council member\nWhen asked about the possibility of the Mack-Cali building being converted to residential apartments, Peluso said: \u201cI can\u2019t discuss items from closed sessions unless approved by township attorney.\u201d\nCarifi said he is aware of talks about housing in that location but he was advised by township attorney John Inglesino not to speak about specifics. \u201cUnfortunately, the town attorney has advised us not to discuss it,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise I would like to.\u201d\nCarifi said he shares Tappen\u2019s concerns that too much of the deal will be done in back rooms. He said it wouldn\u2019t be out of character for the mayor to present it at the last second, leaving him not enough time for research and not enough time to get proper input from the public. Carifi said he thinks time might be on his side this time, however, because it\u2019s an election year.\n\u201cHe is going to try to push this off until after June [elections] because of the uproar from residents,\u201d Carifi said.\nCarifi said he has been \"flooded\" by emails sent to him by residents concerned with the apartment plan.\n\u201cAfter emails from Carlos and Brian were sent to their associations, all of the residents who live in those areas were definitely quite upset,\u201d Carifi said. \u201cThey had a lot of questions. Everyone that I spoke to was definitely upset.\u201d\nAn initial request for information to the mayor was forwarded to the township attorney who called and said they were not violating any open records requests because the town had sought and received extensions.\nCouncil Member Michael dePierro deferred all calls to the township attorney and wouldn\u2019t confirm any information other than to say \u201cthere\u2019s not much going on right now.\u201d\nCouncil members Louis Valori and Loretta Gragnani did not respond to requests for information.\nA woman who identified herself as being with the zoning board, but would not give her name said the building is currently zoned as SED 10 and that the planning board would have to get involved before it could be converted to residential apartments - a process she said \u201cwould take several months.\u201d\nThe Record has requested the information via OPRA.\nEmail: myers@northjersey.com\u00a0\n3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jFYqBJ\n"]]

The artists and their families became integrated in the community, she said.\nBennett, along with Montclair Planning Board member Carmel Loughman, drafted a report on the home in their pitch to make it a historic landmark.\nBennett said the local designation would put the onus on the homeowner to retain the home\u2019s exterior in\u00a0its original architectural style.\nTax records show the home was built in 1850. Its last owners are listed as James R. and Elizabeth Donald.\nAccording to records in\u00a0the Montclair Public Library, the Earle house\u2019s style was described as \u201clate 19th century/2nd Empire element\u201d in a survey conducted in 1981 for the state\u2019s historical site inventory. Its condition at the time was rated \u201cexcellent.\u201d\nThe exterior at that time was described as stucco, with a mansard roof and interior center chimney.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have many mansard Second Empire examples in Montclair,\u201d Bennett said, noting that the style was popular in Europe at the time and was considered \u201chigh standard.\u201d\nThe home\u2019s significance is described as \u201cone of the last survivors from the 19th century in this neighborhood,\u201d in library records.\nEarle lived at the home from 1897 to 1903, and was among the members of the Montclair Art Colony, from 1895 to 1908, the records indicate.\nEarle was originally from Grand Rapids, Mich. He lived in\u00a0the Montclair home with his wife, Nellie, and sons John H. and Lawrence H., according to lcearle.com, a website dedicated to the artist. His family became \u201cvery involved\u201d with the Montclair Dramatic Club, and Earle was a founding member of the Montclair Art Museum, the website says.\nAmong his well-known paintings was one for the Liberal Arts Building at the Columbian Exhibition of 1893. He is also known for his \u201cDutch Boy Painter,\" which became the logo for the Dutch Boy Paint Company.\nThe HPC had recommended the historic designation of Earle\u2019s home to the municipal Planning Board, which approved it in December. The ordinance would go before the Township Council on Jan. 24 for a first reading.\n\u201cWe have artists and architects in town that people are losing the knowledge of, so I think it\u2019s important to promote this, to let people to know what we had in town and still have,\u201d Bennettt said.\nEmail: gray@northjersey.com\n16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2iwepER\n"]]

She said the\u00a0registry does\u00a0not\u00a0provide any\u00a0protections, but it does at least document the murals and front\u00a0of the building in a national registry\u00a0and brings attention to the building. McGuire also stated that this was just the first step to seeing if the building could be preserved.\nEMERSON: Borough 'history' a mystery\nThe borough\u00a0is\u00a0considering renovating, or outright replacing\u00a0Borough\u00a0Hall.\u00a0According to Mayor Louis\u00a0Lamatina, a 2014 study was done that suggests\u00a0that the building would need to increase from approximately 8,000\u00a0square\u00a0feet to approximately 20,000\u00a0square\u00a0feet in order to accommodate\u00a0the borough's needs.\nCurrently, Borough Hall houses the town's administrative offices, as well as the municipal court and the police department. One of several options borough officials are considering is\u00a0consolidating its ambulance corps into the building.\nThe Borough Council has reviewed architectural proposals for the Borough Hall project, as well as potentially building a new,\u00a0separate\u00a0ambulance corps or emergency services building and\u00a0a\u00a0community\u00a0center. The council is expected to discuss the selection of an architect at their meeting Tuesday, according to the meeting agenda.\nMcGuire started looking into\u00a0the\u00a0historical registry after a Dec. 6 council meeting\u00a0in which several architects presented\u00a0their plans. Several of the architects suggested either substantial add-ons to the front of\u00a0Borough\u00a0Hall, or\u00a0constructing a\u00a0new building.\nMcGuire, who lives\u00a0next to\u00a0Borough\u00a0Hall, stated\u00a0at that meeting\u00a0that she didn\u2019t want to see the building\u00a0taken\u00a0down, and that she felt that at least the front of the building was\u00a0too\u00a0integral to the town\u2019s history to be replaced.\n\u201cI understand that the building needs to be renovated, I just want to make sure that we keep the building\u2019s historical significance intact as well,\u201d McGuire said.\nIn response,\u00a0Lamatina\u00a0said, \"The murals can certainly be preserved. As far as the front of the building, again, we will listen to the architect's recommendation and decide accordingly.\"\nBorough Administrator Robert Hoffman\u00a0stated that he is looking into ways to preserve the murals, and had even\u00a0researched\u00a0a program at the University of Texas that specializes in preserving paintings and murals.\nThe seven murals\u00a0are believed to have been\u00a0painted\u00a0when\u00a0Borough Hall was built as part of a Works Progress Administration project in 1939.\u00a0The murals range from wacky to thoughtful, each unique to the time period and art style of the late\u00a01930s.\nEmail: carroll@northjersey.com\n26 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jIStDX\n"]]

Trump has already threatened to have his opponent imprisoned if he wins!\nGiven Trump's nature and how he has such thin skin when it comes to criticism and him even saying they should cancel Saturday Night Live because he didn't like how Alec Baldwin was portraying him, can you imagine what he would do if he got his hands on the power that the presidency allows a person?!\nIf the past is any indicator, given his vindictive nature, it's not a stretch to think that Trump could make a list of his detractors right away after getting into office and someone like Lazarus being Muslim and so outspoken the way he is, would be on that list I'm sure.\nHere below at this link is what current President, Barrack Obama had to say about Trump's reaction to the Saturday Night Live skits. Obama also states that Trump is not someone 'you want in charge of nuclear weapons' given his nature. https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/10155551774211509/?pnref=story\nI remember watching videos and reading interviews about Hip Hop artist Lazarus AKA Kamran Rashid Khan a few years ago and have followed his work ever since. Khan was studying medicine at the time in Detroit and releasing music simultaneously.\nToday he is a practicing physician in Las Vegas, where he lives with his wife. He is a very unique and multi-talented individual and his life's work thus far is very impressive and he has a bright future..........that is if The Donald doesn't get elected and makes that list! You never know what Muslims will face if a Trump presidency becomes a reality. It is sad to think that in a country like America such discussions are even being had in this day and age with all of supposed evolution our species has gone through.\nLazarus' current song includes this verse: \"Donald wants my arm embedded, Muslims cannot stay here. Now I'm feeling like a mutant but am I Magnus or Xavier?\" When asked for his thoughts about that verse in an interview with the Examiner, Lazarus stated that: \"It's like the comic book \"X-Men.\" As silly as it may sound, Muslims are the new mutants of today's society. Senator Kelly in the \"X-Men\" and Donald Trump are basically saying the same thing. There is supposed violence taking place by Muslims somewhere, now we must propose a ban on them all.\"\nKamran Rashid Khan which the name given to him at birth, originally started rapping without a stage name but later changed his name to Lazarus due to hate crimes and racial stereotyping he saw around him and personally experienced. He stated in an interview with The Source magazine that after 9/11 he felt that his chances of becoming a rapper were finished and that his stage name metaphors the biblical character that resurrected from the dead.\nFast forward some fifteen plus years later, he is now using this resurrection to educate people through his music and share his own personal outrage at what is going on in America.\nToday's expressions of freedom of speech could turn into tomorrow's prison sentences the way things are trending in North America and I know from personal experience that all of this could happen in a first world country.

It housed the Fire Department\u2019s headquarters and even a stage where the council chambers are now, Wassmann said.\nIt is less clear if the murals were commissioned under the Federal Art Project, a section of the WPA in which hundreds of artists were hired to create more than 100,000 paintings, including murals, across the country during the Great Depression. Much of the artwork produced under the program was in government buildings.\nIn Emerson, most of the New Deal-era murals are scattered throughout the seldom-used basement in a conference room, in a police radio equipment room, and in old jail cells now used to store evidence.\nWhile the sea monster mural is perhaps the most striking, several others have tongue-in-cheek themes \u2013 and are not the usual decorative fare chosen for government buildings. Many are signed by someone named \"Haring\" and are dated as having been painted in 1939.\nIn the conference room, one mural depicts a police officer approaching an older man in a bowler hat surrounded by brightly colored, cartoonish elephants and other strange figures. The caption below the mural reads, \"All right you guys, break it up!\"\nIn a small room off the conference room, another mural shows a group of rowdy people \u2013 including one woman with an exposed breast \u2013 on a boardwalk as a flag with \"Emerson\" written on it flies in the background.\nThe murals on the walls of the old jail cells are the most thematically appropriate. These were the \"drunk tanks,\" where people arrested for public intoxication or drunken driving could sober up under close supervision.\n\"Don\u2019t mix alcohol and gas: modern conditions demand clear thinking,\" says the message accompanying one mural. \"The world\u2019s meanest: the hit and run driver. Will your home be next?\" asks another.\nNew Deal-era art programs were conceived to help lift artists out of poverty while serving the larger purpose of giving ordinary Americans wider access to art and culture. Diana L. Linden, an art historian and an expert on WPA murals, said that they tended to be painted in schools, community centers, jail, libraries and post offices.\nWhile she wasn\u2019t familiar with Emerson\u2019s murals, she said it is uncommon for paintings commissioned under the Federal Art Project to depict nudity or other outlandish things \u2014 for instance, a sea monster hoisting aloft a nude woman and a frosty mug of beer.\n\"They tended to be very safe in terms of imagery with upbeat messages,\" Linden said. \"Though they did tend to tailor the message to whatever building\u2019s function was. So imprisonment in a jail cell makes sense.\"\nDespite what they may depict or whether they were definitively commissioned under the Federal Art Project, Linden said it is important to preserve any artwork from that period. Many New Deal-era paintings and other artwork were destroyed or lost in the 1950s, when Cold War fears led some people to conclude that they represented \"communist propaganda.\"\n\"To get rid of murals like this, it goes against most preservation and historical rules,\" Linden said. \"The New Deal was a unique moment, and in terms of artists it was the first time the government really made a stand, saying artists matter to society and gave them a role in society and helping to heal the effects of the Great Depression.\"\nBorough Administrator Bob Hoffmann said that after Borough Hall flooded in June 2015, he became concerned that humidity was causing the murals to deteriorate. Several of the murals have begun to fade, and paint has started to chip around the edges.\nSince then, Hoffmann said, the borough has fixed the flooding problem and the air conditioning system in the basement, making it \"noticeably less humid.\"\nLater this year a professional specializing in art restoration will inspect the murals, Hoffmann said, and recommend techniques to preserve them.\nBorough officials have begun discussing the possibility of renovating Borough Hall since the purchase earlier this year of two properties across the street from the municipal building. Regardless of what happens, if anything, Hoffmann said he is committed to making sure the murals are preserved.\n\"No matter what renovations happen or whatever happens here, we can preserve them,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a piece of Emerson\u2019s history and U.S. history. We walk by history every day in Borough Hall.\"\n"]]

Imagine having this realization with the knowledge that because of this part of yourself, your parents may never talk to you again, you'll lose your job, lose your housing, or your physical safety may be threatened.\nNational Coming Out Day is a reminder that for many LGBTQ youth, the idea of coming out is intimidating, anxiety-inducing, and even downright scary. The rejection and hatred that may be waiting for them on the other side of such an important, personal confession can be paralyzing and isolating. All of our youth face enormous challenges, but with the additional obstacles faced by LGBTQ youth, they are 4 times as likely as their straight peers to attempt suicide. It doesn't have to be this way.\nMythic Bridge supports at-risk youth through the transformative power of filmmaking. We enable them to actualize their potential through filmmaking workshops. In honor of National Coming Out Day, we are promoting our LGBTQ filmmaking programs. This series of workshops were created specifically for LGBTQ youth and their supportive straight peers.\nThrough our programming, kids are able to share their stories in a safe, accepting environment and learn that their voices have value and the power to break through to the community. Man to Man is a short film produced during our July LGBT Workshops which tells the story of a young man struggling to come out to his brother during a game of 1-on-1 basketball:\nWe have teamed up with creative agencies Happy United and Rabbit Rabbit & Partners to help us start the vital conversation that we need to support LGBTQ youth. Our goal is to raise awareness about this issue and our work at Mythic Bridge. To this end, our Change the Script campaign celebrates a supportive, creative community that has the power to change the lives of LGBTQ youth.\nLast month, we launched our first spot, Change the Script : LGBTQ Suicide PSA.\nOur Change the Script campaign has continued with a portrait series made up of people who support LGBTQ youth and our filmmaking workshops. Participants in the series share their personal stories on how they would like to \" Change The Script .\" Transgender super-model Geena Rocero has partnered with us and is a champion for this campaign. She says...\nOther luminaries from the film community such as actress Alysia Reiner, director Pamela Romanowsky and actor Christian Campbell, along with Mythic Bridge mentors, workshop participants and other supporters of LGBTQ youth have participated in the series.\nThere are many ways to lend your support. This is ours. Alongside our effort to promote awareness, we've launched a CrowdRise to raise the money necessary to continue our efforts. We are asking you to donate to \" Change the Script \" for LGBTQ youth.\nOur campaign is on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, we'll continue to share the stories of our LGBTQ teens and their vocal supporters as they Change the Script for our youth.

[["name", "new_7/2005.html"], ["url", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-kronick/10-powerful-ways-successful-people-overcome-fear_b_12414162.html"], ["text", "10 Powerful Ways Successful People Overcome Fear\n10/10/2016 01:53 pm ET | Updated Oct 10, 2016\nRichard Kronick Author, teacher, speaker, coach. Self-proclaimed luckiest man alive.\nOne thing that most successful\u00a0people have in common is that they have managed to overcome the paralyzing effects of fear. To become successful in anything we have to take action despite being scared, to be courageous in the face of fear. So how can we develop the ability to bulldoze our way through fear? It turns out there are some simple techniques that we can practice that will help us do just that. Try these 10 ways successful people overcome fear and see for yourself\u00a0how anxiety, worry and doubt can melt away in the shadow of your own inner power.\n1. Stand Up Straight\nIt turns out one of the easiest ways to feel more confident and strong is to simply stand up straight. In her incredible TED talk , Harvard researcher Dr. Amy Cuddy has shown that by standing or sitting in a \"power pose\" ( see the poses here ) you actually increase hormones which make you feel more confident and decrease hormones which makes you nervous and stressed. It's simple yet effective.\n2. Smile\nYep, this too is simple. There is a lot of\u00a0 research showing that smiling can not only make you feel better, but it can also reduce your stress levels too. Lucky for you, there's no need to even read the research because you can try it anytime you want!\n3. Take a Cold Shower\nThe thought alone of taking a cold shower may fill you with anxiety, but it's all about asserting control over your life. Facing a fear and overcoming it is a surefire way to develop greater self-confidence. If you've succeeded in taking a cold shower, then the next time you face a challenge, you can say to yourself, \"If I can power through an ice cold shower, surely I can do this too.\"\n4. Embrace\u00a0What You Cannot Change\nWe cannot always control what happens to us, but we can choose how we react to what happens. Though it isn't always easy, we do have the power over our mental and emotional states, if we choose to assert our authority. Nobody else feels your fear, only you do. It exists within you.\u00a0One way to increase your personal power is to recognize that which we cannot change and embrace it. Accepting what we cannot change is, paradoxically, very empowering, because we then realize that we don't need to waste our time trying to change what cannot be changed and instead work on changing ourselves and our reaction to what is happening around us.\n5. Don't Think, Don't Try, Just Do\nSometimes all we need to overcome fear is to just take the first step. It is easy to get caught up in over-analyzing something and by simply jumping in and taking some action we can gain momentum. Before we know it the obstacles we feared have long been overcome.\n6. Deep Breathing\nIn moments of stress or fear, taking a few slow, deep breaths has been shown to relieve mental and physical stress and enhance decision-making abilities.\n7. Overwhelm Negativity With Positivity\nFear comes from negative thoughts; worries of what might happen. Most fears in life never actually materialize, yet we spend\u00a0so much time thinking about\u00a0'what ifs'. The next time you find yourself overwhelmed by all the scary things that might happen, try bombarding your mind with positive and empowering thoughts and affirmations. Affirmations\u00a0really do work, but they take time and persistence.\n8. Gratitude\nFew emotions are as powerful as gratitude. There is no room for fear or\u00a0doubt inside a grateful mind, for the feeling of gratitude takes up the entire emotional space of our being. Gratitude banishes fear. How can we induce the feeling of gratitude? One way is to start listing off all of the things you are grateful for. Life itself is a gift, your heart is a gift, the air you breathe is too. Another way is to use this powerful Zen affirmation .\n9. Get\u00a0a Power Rock\nGo outside and wander around until you find a rock or crystal that you like and is small enough to keep in your pocket. In the morning, afternoon and before sleeping hold the rock for about a minute. While you do, imagine that the rock is emanating enormous strength, power and courage and filling your entire being with radiant power. Carry the rock with you and turn to it as needed. The rock itself may not have any inherent power, but you imbue it with great power.\n10. Imagine and Rehearse Success\nIn moments of fear, step back and imagine yourself successfully overcoming the obstacle you face. Picture yourself having already succeeded. Imagine the pats on the back and the handshakes. Really let yourself feel how it will feel when you succeed. Rehearse it over and over in your mind. This should give you a surge of confidence and direct your focus on achievement, rather than fear.\n\u00a0\nA Final Word on Fear\nIn the end, it helps to remember that we are the source of fear, not our circumstances. Sure, fear is usually a reaction to something happening\u00a0around us, but the feeling of fear arises within you. Remember, if you created it, you can take it away.\n\u00a0\nThis article originally appeared on Completed Thoughts .

We can navigate using the spirit, or using the mind. The spirit will put us into contact with soul expression and expansion, while the mind will put us into contact with schemes and strategies.\nAlthough most people live their lives from a place of doing, in other words living through the mind, the quality of our life resides in our being, or living through the spirit. Taking it one step further, living through the mind is fear-based while living through the spirit is love-based. When we conduct our lives from a place of being rather than doing, we walk into uncertainty. We surrender to the outcome. The act of surrender may sound fearful, but in this case it is actually rooted in love and belief.\nWhen we plan, organizing every step and making sure we've covered all bases, the core of these actions is fear. True fear comes from wanting to protect ourselves instead of wanting to let go. Generally, people have it backwards: They think to surrender is fearful. And while we are not sure of the exact outcome, one thing is certain: The outcome will be far more miraculous than that of any plan we could have prepared.\nIt is when we release our angst and stop striving, pleading, worrying and doing \"as much as we can\" that we tap into pure flow. Pure flow comes from our spirit, from love, from the essence of the universe. Nature does not hurry, strive or worry, yet everything happens in due time. All growth, blossoming and withering gently occur. Nature does not have a mind. However, it has something vaster than the mind, and that is the intelligence of the universe. If we allow our lives to come from a place of being, we open ourselves up to infinite intelligence as well.\nThe mind is very powerful. When you set your mind on something, you can definitely achieve it, and manifest your desires into reality. Such a statement would generally be associated with a lot of doing and striving. However, once a person sets their intention, and surrenders the final outcome to the universe, their results will be spectacular. When we know what we want, but surrender the process of achieving it to the intelligence far greater than anything our mind can perceive, we begin living lives beyond our wildest dreams.\nSo how does one achieve this kind of life? First of all, set an intention for what you'd like your future to look like, in your career or personal life or both. The fact is, if something is brewing within you, it is meant to be a part of your destiny. The first step to living out your purpose is to imagine a specific life that makes you happy. People do not want the same things. If you have a specific desire within you, then it is time to start giving it more energy and taking small steps towards it.\nThe next step towards living with purpose is to ask yourself if what you are doing, at each moment of your day, is coming from a place of love or fear. There are no other options. Human beings function on the essence of those two emotions. If you feel excited, happy or hopeful about something, you are functioning on love. If you feel dread, worry or resistance towards something, you are functioning on fear. The energy of love expands our life to encompass more possibilities. The energy of fear constricts our life within a box. So, to move forward with love in your heart is to live with your being. This mentality will put you in touch with the flow of life.\nThese two steps - setting an intention for the life you want, and taking small steps towards it with love each day - are the most profound things you can do to tap into your being. It sounds simple. However, it takes courage and work. The mind loves to control; that is its job. But with control comes a domino effect of other hindrances, such as worry and fear, that end up blocking our vast potential.\nThe choice is always yours. If you feel you've done all you can do, yet feel there is more that can be attained, then let it go. It takes courage, faith, belief and trust to surrender. Attaining these traits requires training the mind. But when you do so, and live from being rather than doing, then you are actually living. You are moving towards Oneness with all that is. You are opening yourself up to the greatness that resides within you, waiting to be released. The intelligence of the universe can provide us with a life far grander than the intelligence of our minds ever could. Our function is to know what we want, believe we can get it, surrender to the process and wait for the miracles to unfold.\nMore:\n"]]

I use this app every day. At the end of the day I can listen to all things considered or morning edition and listen to all of the stories sequentially in my car. It doesn't use any Data to download all of these episodes from the program for that day. By Saturday at 2 o'clock, I listen to Saturday edition as I'm driving. I can listen to each story sequentially. Doesn't get better than that. If I want a change I can listen to this American life, the hidden brain, the moth, or any of their excellent programs.\nIt's free, and you get to choose what you want to watch versus NPR one which attempts to choose stuff for me. Don't like that. I've never had the app crash. It does occasionally stop when my radar detector goes off but otherwise it has been rock stable.\nAddendum: it's 2017 and this is still the best NPR app there is. I don't particularly like NPR one because it's like the Pandora of NPR podcasts. I don't like having podcast chosen for me by an algorithm. This wonderful app allows me to choose the program I want to, select from all available episodes and run them sequentially, and appears to use no cellular data when I listen to it in my car. I have two words: Cades!, And two more words use it! You won't regret it.\nNPR. Delivered through an app. Could use a makeover, though.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nby                    partaypooper\nI usually use the NPR One app while I'm commuting, but around the house, or during my downtime, I like to use the NPR app (branding is hard; I feel you, devs). Fantastic for casually browsing a stylized feed and whatnot.\nSo functionally, the app is nigh perfect; it's easy to use, and additional features are clearly thought-out and implemented well. However (yep, there it is)....I mean, the UI looked dated two years ago; at this point it belongs in the NPR Archives.\nAll kidding aside, though, this is a great app. I'd also recommend the NPR One app for a much simpler (albeit less comprehensive) app for your commute, workout, etc. *But* I'm rating 4 stars for now because, c'mon guys; the thing's already perfected, let's give it a new paint job (self-plug: I do happen to be a registered iOS dev; write me if you're open to contractual work).\nNPR Always\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nby                    indigo ebony\nMobile platform has worked very well for me, living in a rural area of the Midwest out of range, most days, of reliable radio reception for city stations of NPR.  I appreciate the exposure to an impressive variety of programs - in-depth news that is more balanced than most commercial news, music that includes jazz, classical, Latino and World as well as lesser-known artists.  There is abundant food for thought and personal growth - from \"The Splendid Table\" to \"The TED Radio Hour\", from \"Invisibilia\" to \"The Best of Car Talk\" plus locally-produced programs varying state to state.  Thanks for making NPR available anywhere my phone has reception!\nCustomers Also Bought\n"]]

Hotel Lease And The Agency Holding It Has No Plan\n\u201cIt does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this.\"\n01/14/2017 07:01 am ET | Updated 1 day ago\n2.8k\nPaul Blumenthal Money in Politics Reporter, The Huffington Post\nWASHINGTON \u2015 When explaining how he would (somewhat)\u00a0 extricate himself from his myriad conflicts of interest \u00a0this week, President-elect Donald Trump and his tax lawyer completely ignored what would happen to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. It looks like he also failed to discuss that with the government agency that holds the hotel lease.\nTrump\u2019s deal with the General Services Administration to operate a hotel in the Old Post Office building specifically states that the lease cannot be held by an elected official . And the clock is ticking down to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nYet the GSA released a statement on Wednesday, after the president-elect\u2019s press conference, indicating that it was not aware of his plans for the Trump Organization until he announced them to the public.\nThis is a legitimate international scandal and they\u2019re not part of the conversation. Procurement law expert Steve Schooner, on the GSA\n\u201cGSA understands that an announcement has been made to change the business structure of the Trump Organization,\u201d\u00a0the agency said in a statement . \u201cWe are seeking additional information that explains and describes any new organizational structure as it applies to the Old Post Office lease. Upon receipt, consistent with our treatment of any contract to which we are a party, we will review this new organizational structure and determine its compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease.\u201d\nThe agency\u2019s apparent lack of knowledge is \u201cextraordinary,\u201d according to Steven Schooner, a government procurement law professor at George Washington University.\n\u201cIt does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this,\u201d said Schooner, a former government contracting official at the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cThis is a legitimate international scandal and they\u2019re not part of the conversation.\u201d\nThe GSA did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe lease for the D.C. hotel was signed in 2013 and Trump announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. That means the agency has had nearly two years to come up with a plan on what to do if Trump won the presidency. So far, it has refused to state publicly whether it thinks Trump will be in violation of his lease the moment he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced his plans to hand over control of his business \u00a0to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, while still maintaining his ownership stake. Such an arrangement does little to nothing to resolve any conflicts related to the business. Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, called the plan \u201cmeaningless\u201d and far short of the steps that every other modern president has taken to eliminate financial conflicts upon taking office.\nMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images\nEric, Donald and Melania Trump cut the\u00a0ribbon at\u00a0the grand opening of\u00a0the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 26, 2016.\nThe hotel lease with the GSA clearly states, \u201cNo member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\u201d\nSince Trump will keep his ownership in the Trump Organization, he will inevitably remain a beneficiary of the lease.\nThe GSA has another Trump-related problem looming. As president, Trump can and probably will name a new head of the agency. That person will be in charge of annual lease negotiations with the president\u2019s sons.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an imbalance of power,\u201d Schooner previously noted to HuffPost. \u201cIn a 60-year, complicated contract, we\u2019re going to ask a civil servant at GSA to negotiate annually with the president\u2019s children.\u201d\nThe fact that the GSA was left out of the loop on Trump\u2019s business plans fits with how the president-elect and his company lawyers have treated the Office of Government Ethics.\u00a0Shaub has said he lost touch with the Trump team after the election and attempted to get their attention with a stream of tweets calling on the president-elect to fully divest his business holdings.\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told HuffPost that he is \u201cvery concerned\u201d in light of the latest GSA statement.\n\u201cI think they were reluctant to give a decision early on,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cIn other words, before he violates it.\u201d\nCummings added, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, I guess, see next Monday after he\u2019s sworn in. I expect that there will be a decision on [Jan. 20].\u201d\nThe GSA\u2019s current silence on the hypothetical violation of the lease is consistent with its past public assertions.\nBack in December, Cummings and Rep.

Hotel Lease And The Agency Holding It Has No Plan\n\u201cIt does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this.\"\n1 day ago | Updated 1 day ago\nPaul Blumenthal Money in Politics Reporter, The Huffington Post\nWASHINGTON \u2015 When explaining how he would (somewhat)\u00a0 extricate himself from his myriad conflicts of interest \u00a0this week, President-elect Donald Trump and his tax lawyer completely ignored what would happen to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. It looks like he also failed to discuss that with the government agency that holds the hotel lease.\nTrump\u2019s deal with the General Services Administration to operate a hotel in the Old Post Office building specifically states that the lease cannot be held by an elected official . And the clock is ticking down to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nYet the GSA released a statement on Wednesday, after the president-elect\u2019s press conference, indicating that it was not aware of his plans for the Trump Organization until he announced them to the public.\nThis is a legitimate international scandal and they\u2019re not part of the conversation. Procurement law expert Steve Schooner, on the GSA\n\u201cGSA understands that an announcement has been made to change the business structure of the Trump Organization,\u201d\u00a0the agency said in a statement . \u201cWe are seeking additional information that explains and describes any new organizational structure as it applies to the Old Post Office lease. Upon receipt, consistent with our treatment of any contract to which we are a party, we will review this new organizational structure and determine its compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease.\u201d\nThe agency\u2019s apparent lack of knowledge is \u201cextraordinary,\u201d according to Steven Schooner, a government procurement law professor at George Washington University.\n\u201cIt does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this,\u201d said Schooner, a former government contracting official at the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cThis is a legitimate international scandal and they\u2019re not part of the conversation.\u201d\nThe GSA did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe lease for the D.C. hotel was signed in 2013 and Trump announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. That means the agency has had nearly two years to come up with a plan on what to do if Trump won the presidency. So far, it has refused to state publicly whether it thinks Trump will be in violation of his lease the moment he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced his plans to hand over control of his business \u00a0to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, while still maintaining his ownership stake. Such an arrangement does little to nothing to resolve any conflicts related to the business. Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, called the plan \u201cmeaningless\u201d and far short of the steps that every other modern president has taken to eliminate financial conflicts upon taking office.\nMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images\nEric, Donald and Melania Trump cut the\u00a0ribbon at\u00a0the grand opening of\u00a0the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 26, 2016.\nThe hotel lease with the GSA clearly states, \u201cNo member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\u201d\nSince Trump will keep his ownership in the Trump Organization, he will inevitably remain a beneficiary of the lease.\nThe GSA has another Trump-related problem looming. As president, Trump can and probably will name a new head of the agency. That person will be in charge of annual lease negotiations with the president\u2019s sons.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an imbalance of power,\u201d Schooner previously noted to HuffPost. \u201cIn a 60-year, complicated contract, we\u2019re going to ask a civil servant at GSA to negotiate annually with the president\u2019s children.\u201d\nThe fact that the GSA was left out of the loop on Trump\u2019s business plans fits with how the president-elect and his company lawyers have treated the Office of Government Ethics.\u00a0Shaub has said he lost touch with the Trump team after the election and attempted to get their attention with a stream of tweets calling on the president-elect to fully divest his business holdings.\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told HuffPost that he is \u201cvery concerned\u201d in light of the latest GSA statement.\n\u201cI think they were reluctant to give a decision early on,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cIn other words, before he violates it.\u201d\nCummings added, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, I guess, see next Monday after he\u2019s sworn in. I expect that there will be a decision on [Jan. 20].\u201d\nThe GSA\u2019s current silence on the hypothetical violation of the lease is consistent with its past public assertions.\nBack in December, Cummings and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, sent a letter to the agency asking whether it believed Trump would violate the lease agreement if he did not divest his holdings. The letter, released by Cummings, stated that Michael Gelber, deputy commissioner of the GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service, had said the new president would indeed be in violation.\nThe GSA, however, refused to comment, insisting that it could not make any determination until Trump assumed office.\n\u201cWe can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,\u201d the GSA statement said in December. \u201cIn fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.\u201d\nCongressional Republicans have held no hearings on the issue.\nMore:\n"]]

The team of star Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg was expecting the kind of all-American January hit they achieved four years ago with \" Lone Survivor .\" So was the industry, which saw the film tracking at No. 1 in online sales this weekend at Fandango. Analysts expected the drama to make around $20 million this weekend.\nYet \"Patriots Day\" didn't even crack the top five, finishing instead in sixth place with an estimated $12.0 million. This suggests that the film will be lucky to recoup its reported $45 million budget plus a similar amount in marketing and distribution costs.\nIn fact, of the three new wide releases and three expanding-into-wide-release movies , only one finished in the top five. That was \" The Bye Bye Man ,\" a low budget horror movie with no stars, which nonetheless debuted with nearly twice the $7 million it was projected to earn. In fact, at an estimated $13.4 million, it's within $400,000 of both \" Sing \" and \" Rogue One: A Star Wars Story ,\" for a virtual three-way tie for third place. (Indeed, when final figures are released Tuesday, it could end up ahead of those holdover hits.)\nHow did this underdog succeed where Wahlberg and Berg's epic stumbled? Here are five ways.\n1. Been There, Done That\n\"Patriots Day\" is Wahlberg and Berg's third collaboration, and their formula is apparent, with Wahlberg playing a real-life ordinary-grunt-turned-hero who shows all-American grit and determination in the face of a cataclysm or disaster. Audiences may have found the formula too familiar, since the star and director's \" Deepwater Horizon \" came out just four months ago.\nThat drama opened moderately well, at $20.2 million, but it topped out at $61.4 million, suggesting that viewers were already starting to tire of the formula before \"Patriots Day\" followed fast on \"Horizon\"'s heels.\n2. No Awards Bump\nDespite its decent reviews and awards-season angling, \"Patriots Day\" has been a non-factor during the Golden Globes and Oscar races so far. Not that that should hurt it with audiences -- in fact, \"Patriots\" scored a rare A+ at CinemaScore from paying customers.\nStill, every little bit of positive buzz helps. Look at \" La La Land ,\" which scored a record seven Globe wins last Sunday. It jumped into second place this weekend, after six weeks of release, and earned an estimated $14.5 million, for a total of $74.1 million to date.\n3. Not Enough Appeal to Female Audiences\nAside from \"La La Land,\" the only movie catering to them was \"Bye Bye Man.\" Horror movies do tend to do well in January, since they're usually the only releases targeted at young women during this season of awards hopefuls and holdover holiday blockbusters. The Friday the 13th opening date was a marketing bonus.\n4. Too Much Appeal to Older (Male) Audiences\nSome pundits suggested that \"Patriots\" did well on Fandango because it appeals to an older, affluent audience that is more likely to buy tickets online in advance.\n\"Hidden Figures\" showed its broad, cross-racial appeal last weekend when it edged out \"Rogue One\" for the top spot. Nonetheless, it should have been clear that young people weren't going to show up in great numbers for \"Patriots Day\" after the film's Thursday night preview. It's a given that older viewers aren't going to see a late-night Thursday movie but will wait for the weekend, but the Thursday take of just $560,000 indicated that young people weren't coming either.\nEspecially young women. Did you happen to catch Wahlberg's visit to \" Conan \" this week? The star's fellow Bostonian noted that it's been a quarter-century since Wahlberg went from pop star to Calvin Klein underwear model to movie leading man. These days, the pop star-turned-Klein skivvies model is Justin Bieber .\nAt 45, Wahlberg has aged well out of boy-band fan appeal, and the \"Patriots\" clip screened on \"Conan\" made him look not much younger than co-stars Kevin Bacon and John Goodman . As an aging action hero, he's not Liam Neeson yet, but he's getting there.\n5. Multiplex Pileup\nThere's nothing wrong with relying on an older male demographic... except on a weekend like this one, where several other new or newly-wide releases are competing for the same audience. January is often a movie desert, but this weekend's six new wide movies made for a ticketbuyer traffic jam.\nJamie Foxx 's crime thriller, \" Sleepless ,\" and Ben Affleck 's nostalgic gangster picture, \" Live by Night ,\" chased the same viewers. Berg and Wahlberg can console themselves that their movie did a lot better than those rivals; \"Sleepless\" finished eighth with an estimated $8.5 million, while \"Live by Night\" was way down at No. 11 with an estimated $5.4 million.\nNot to mention Martin Scorsese 's \" Silence ,\" which has also come up empty as an awards contender despite strong reviews, and whose expansion into 747 theaters led to a take of just $1.9 million, for a sixteenth-place finish.\nThe real disaster of the weekend was new kid film \" Monster Trucks ,\" even though it finished seventh with an estimated $10.5 million, about what was expected. Paramount notoriously delayed the film's release twice and then, after the movie had sat on the shelf for nearly a year, the studio took a $115 million write-off in anticipation of its box office failure. Woof. That move is unheard of in modern studio age, pointing that the studio knew they had a waste of space on their hands.\nNonetheless, the studio went ahead with a costly 3,119-screen release, only to see the \"Monster\" flounder against holdover kid hits \"Sing\" and \" Moana .\"\nGiven the movie's reported $125 million cost, it looks like the accountants' dismal predictions were correct. Compared to that belly flop, \"Patriots Day's\" weekend doesn't look so bad.\n"]]

Their failures will lead to tens of millions of dollars in red ink for the studios that backed them. \" Sleepless ,\" an action-thriller with Jamie Foxx , also suffered an underwhelming opening, getting lost in the onslaught of new releases.\n\"There's almost an unprecedented number of films out there,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at comScore. \"It's got to be somewhat daunting and overwhelming for moviegoers.\"\nAmidst the carnage, Fox and Chernin Entertainment's\" Hidden Figures \" retained its box office crown in its second weekend of wide release, earning $20.5 million for the weekend and a projected $25.3 million for the long weekend. That will push its total to $59.7 million. The historical drama about African-American NASA workers during the early days of the space program has been one of the biggest breakouts of awards season.\n\"Hidden Figures\" faced stiff competition from Lionsgate's \" La La Land ,\" riding high after sweeping the Golden Globe Awards, and STX's \" The Bye Bye Man ,\" which earned $14.5 million and $13.4 million, respectively. \"La La Land\" is widely expected to dominate the Oscar nominations. The musical about lovestruck Angelenos should finish the four-day weekend with another $17.5 million in domestic receipts, which would bring its stateside total to more than $77 million.\n\"The Bye Bye Man's\" strong reception is welcome news for STX, which had expected the film to open to roughly $10 million. The horror movie about college students grappling with a deadly supernatural figure cost less than $8 million to produce. It should make $15 million over the four-day holiday. Studio executives said they weren't afraid of the crush of new releases heading into the weekend, because they felt they were the only film targeted to younger females. STX also wanted to release the picture on Friday the 13th, a marketing hook for scary movies.\n\"We knew we were going to be able to get that core audience of females,\" said Kevin Grayson, STX's domestic distribution president. \"Not only did they go on Friday, they continued to go all weekend.\"\nHeading into the weekend, most analysts expected CBS Films and Lionsgate's \"Patriots Day\" to put up more of a fight. The drama about the Boston Marathon Bombing earned $12 million after moving from seven theaters to 3,120 locations. It could make $14.3 million over the four-day stretch. That's below projections -- analysts expected the film to earn as much as $18 million. However, the studios believe that \"Patriots Day\" could benefit from enthusiastic word-of-mouth. Audiences gave the film a rare A+ CinemaScore.\n\"Monster Trucks'\" failure seemed preordained. Last year, Paramount took a $115 million write-down on the film. \"Monster Trucks'\" reception justified that fiscal white-flag waving. It opened to a pallid $10.5 million and a projected $14.1 million over the holiday, a disastrous result given its $125 million budget.\n\"The movie works for the audience it's intended to work for,\" said Megan Colligan, Paramount's marketing and distribution head. \"It did really well in the midwest and south. It was over 50 percent kids. The balance was good between boys and girls...without a whole lot of competition, it will keep plugging along.\"\nParamount has hit a rough patch. The studio was embroiled in a corporate power struggle that pitted the controlling Redstone family against Philippe Dauman, the former chairman of Paramount's parent company Viacom. The Redstones ultimately prevailed, but the pressure is now on Paramount chief Brad Grey to prove he can deliver more hits. The studio scored with \"Fences\" and \"Arrival,\" but lost millions on the likes of \"Allied,\" \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,\" and \"Ben-Hur.\"\n\"Live by Night's\" troubles will hit Affleck hard. He directed, produced, and wrote the Dennis LeHane adaptation, and took a starring role as a charismatic rum runner. Warner Bros. is releasing the $65 million production. It earned a sallow $5.4 million and should end the four-day holiday with just over $6 million, which more or less leaves the gangster picture on the slab. Affleck should be on firmer commercial ground reprising his Dark Knight role in \"Justice League\" later this year.\nOpen Road's \"Sleepless\" didn't fare too well either, although it cost significantly less than \"Live by Night\" and \"Monster Trucks.\" The $30 million production stars Foxx as a morally compromised cop whose extracurricular activities endanger his son. It kicked off with a meager $8.5 million and should end the long weekend with $10.1 million in the till. The studio says that \"Sleepless\" will make its way into the black because Open Road covered its financial exposure by selling foreign distribution rights and through tax rebates.\n\"Given our economics, this $10 million opening on 'Sleepless' will certainly become profitable for Open Road,\" said a spokeswoman.\nThen there's \"Silence,\" a decades-in-the-making religious drama. Scorsese struggled for years to cobble together the financing for this story about Jesuit priests who risk torture and death to spread the gospel in feudal Japan, but audiences seemed to have little appetite for his rumination on faith. \"Silence\" expanded from 51 theaters to 747 locations, earning just over $2 million for the long weekend. The $50 million film was financed independently. Paramount is distributing the picture.\n\"Marty Scorsese is one of the greatest living filmmakers,\" said Colligan. \"He's earned the right to independently finance a movie and make the movie he wants to make. This is a complicated, beautiful film, one that movie critics have named the best of the year and one that will be taught in film schools for years. It needs to be judged on its merits.\"\nHoldovers \"Sing\" and \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" continued to show strength, with both films earning roughly $13.8 million. \"Sing,\" the latest collaboration between the \"Despicable Me\" team of Universal and Illumination, has earned $237.2 million stateside. \"Rogue One\" is now the top-grossing 2016 release with more than $500 million in receipts. It will cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office this week.\n"]]

HUGE ones. Fly away, sweet summer child, if you want to stay pure!\nA Girl really wanted to ignore the rumored leak of the entire \"Game of Thrones\" Season 7 plot, but ... scenes keep getting confirmed. Here's another one.\nAccording to the script leak (which started on Reddit and went from there ), Jon brings a wight to the Dragonpit in King's Landing to convince a large group of characters that the Seven Kingdoms need to unite against the true threat north of the Wall. To get the wight, Jon had taken a team north; that team reportedly included Tormund Giantsbane, Beric Dondarrion, The Hound, Thoros of Myr, Jorah, and -- it seems -- even the long-absent Gendry.\nHere's part of what happens next, as relayed in the Daily Mail :\n\"But they are attacked and surrounded on an island on a frozen lake by the Night's King, where Thoros is killed by a wight polar bear (meaning Beric is down to his last life). Jon Snow's uncle Benjen AKA Coldhands is also killed protecting Jon.\nThe group are rescued by Daenerys and her three dragons - but not before Viserion is killed by the Night's King.\nHe then resurrects the dragon as his own mount - who now breathes blue flame - and uses him to destroy The Wall.\"\nThat sounds cool as hell, although very sad for Thoros, Coldhands, and Viserion. But if that's confirmed then it suggests other things we really don't want to be true are also probably true. (Other bits have already been confirmed through Watchers on the Wall filming spoilers.)\nWatchers on the Wall recently shared intel that seemed to confirm the wight storyline spoilers, with Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Paul Kaye (Thoros of Myr), and Joe Dempsie (Gendry) photographed in Iceland.\nA photo posted by gotseason7_news (@gotseason7_news) on\nJan 11, 2017 at 4:04am PST\nA photo posted by gotseason7_news (@gotseason7_news) on\nJan 12, 2017 at 8:32am PST\nAnd here's a photo from a few weeks ago in Northern Ireland, where GoT filming is based, showing Jorah, Tormund, and Benjen/Coldhands:\nA photo posted by gotseason7_news (@gotseason7_news) on\nDec 17, 2016 at 6:29am PST\nNow here's WotW tying everything together, like that rug in \"The Big Lebowski\":\n\"Dempsie and his character, the bastard blacksmith Gendry, have been absent from Game of Thrones since season three when he rowed off to parts unknown. Dempsie turned up on the set of Thrones in October during Spain filming, shooting with Liam Cunningham (Davos) and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion). Later photos showed Gendry taking off in a boat with Jon Snow, Davos, and Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen).\nBack in September, we learned Kaye would be returning as Thoros, the Brotherhood without Banners' red priest. So how does he wind up with Gendry, filming in Iceland which plays the part of the icy land beyond the Wall? Season 7 spoilers have indicated the Brotherhood will be teaming up with Jon's crew on a dangerous mission involving wights. The actors' arrival in Iceland is another piece of confirmation of the early spoiler reports.\"\nWhat's true? What's false? What's in between? We won't know for sure until \"Game of Thrones\" premieres this summer. But if the entire script for the whole season was leaked in advance ... man ... someone is going to get Ned Stark'd by D&D.\n"]]

Time_Sports\nJimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka has died at the age of 73 after a battle with stomach cancer.\n(Photo: Jeff Daly, AP)\nLegendary professional wrestler and WWE Hall of Famer Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, who thrilled fans for decades with his splash from the top rope as one of the original high flyers, died Sunday. He was 73. \u00c2\u00a0\nHis daughter, who wrestles\u00c2\u00a0under the name Tamina Snuka, posted on Instagram with the hashtag #BestDad to announce Snuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\nA photo posted by SaronaSnuka (@saronasnukawwe) on\nJan 15, 2017 at 11:19am PST\nThe family did not release a cause of death, although Snuka had extensive surgery after being diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2015 and has been in declining health.\nSnuka, who was from the Fiji Islands, had three stints with World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment and was inducted into the\u00c2\u00a0Hall of Fame in 1996.\nSnuka most famously feuded with Magnificent Muraco. Snuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leap off the top of the steel cage onto Muraco in October 1983 at Madison Square Garden\u00c2\u00a0is among the most iconic images in pro wrestling history.\nSnuka also is noted for his 1984 feud with Rowdy Roddy Piper, which included Piper making fun of Snuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s South Pacific heritage by hitting him over the head with a coconut. Snuka would be in the corner of Hulk Hogan and Mister T for their tag team match against Piper and Paul Orndorff at the original 1985 Wrestlemania.\nHis WrestleMania history also includes being the first opponent of The Undertaker, who would go on to win 21 consecutive matches at the company's biggest show of the year. His last WrestleMania match was in a legends match with Ricky Steamboat and Piper against Chris Jericho at Wrestlemania 25.\nSnuka also wrestled in ECW, AWA, TNA, WCW, and other independent organizations and was in the ring as recently as 2014.\u00c2\u00a0\nHis death comes two weeks after murder charges were dropped because of his health in the death of his girlfriend in 1983. Charges were filed in September 2015 after prosecutors reopened the case following a plea from Nancy Argentino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family.\nSnuka was moved to hospice care in Florida last fall\u00c2\u00a0and given six months to live, his lawyer Robert Kirwan II told the court in December in a hearing to re-evaluate whether Snuka was competent to stand trial. At the time, his wife told the judge that the family was struggling to keep him from leaving home during episodes of psychosis because he thinks he is late for a match.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe judge ruled in June that Snuka was not competent to stand trial because of dementia and other health issues, but the charges remained in place until they were dismissed this month.\u00c2\u00a0\nSnuka was charged with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Argentino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was found in a hotel room in Whitehall Township, Pa., and the coroner determined she had a skull fracture. Snuka had said she died in a fall, although his version\u00c2\u00a0has changed over the years in various retellings.\nAfter the charges were initially filed, WWE suspended Snuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legends contract and removed his page from the Hall of Fame portion of its website. The company, along with others in the pro wrestling community, reacted to his death on Twitter.\nBREAKING: WWE is saddened to learn that WWE Hall of Famer Jimmy \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuperfly\u00e2\u0080\u009d Snuka has passed away. https://t.co/VBNyosQIVL pic.twitter.com/L8MaD6Rezx\n"]]

Assembly hearings begin Wednesday; Senate hearings begin Jan. 27.\nThe cost of public education accounts for the largest portion of property tax bills and roughly a third of the state budget.\nAs the Democrats bicker, time is running out before Gov. Chris Christie holds his annual budget address on Feb. 28. Barring a compromise solution, the governor could try to implement a plan he has been touting around the state to give districts a flat sum of $6,599 per student, no matter where the student lives or the area's income level.\nChristie's plan is anathema to Democrats and would likely face a legal challenge if implemented. But the ensuing confrontation between Christie and the Legislature could be messy and could throw local school districts into turmoil as they try to write their annual budgets without certainty over how much funding they would get from the state.\nThe battle over school funding in New Jersey goes back decades. In 1981, the Newark-based Education Law Center sued the state on behalf of urban children, challenging how public schools were funded.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in Abbott v. Burke that the state must give high-poverty districts enough aid so they can spend the same per student on basic education as the richest districts, plus additional aid to pay for special needs of poor students. The \"Abbott\" districts got more funding starting around 1998. But another legal challenge led the state to adopt the School Funding Reform Act of 2008, which uses a weighted formula to steer more money to school districts based on their number of high-need students and not on whether they are Abbott districts alone.\nThe change was supposed to help non-Abbott districts with large or growing numbers of poor students, but Christie has not fully funded the schools under the formula in the face of other budget concerns.\nSweeney is\u00a0advocating a plan to\u00a0salvage the School Funding Reform Act by removing funding caps for districts with increasing enrollment.\u00a0He also wants to end a provision that protects districts from having their funding cut even if they lose students or\u00a0experience other demographic changes. Both provisions were originally intended to be temporary but they have survived into the present day.\nUnder Sweeney's plan, all schools would get full funding under the state formula within five years via updates to the state funding formula and a proposed additional $500 million.\n\u201cThe original school funding law was constitutional, it was fair and it was equitable,\u201d Sweeney said this week about the School Funding Reform Act. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t being distributed or funded properly. Some districts are receiving 40 percent or less of the aid they deserve while others get 140 percent or more.\u201d\n\u201cIf it were to be as simple as doing those two things, this would have been done years ago,\u201d Prieto shot back Friday about the two main elements of Sweeney's proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\nHe said the Senate president\u2019s plan could actually exacerbate inequities in state aid and the hearings are necessary to explore other alternatives.\nAt an unrelated news conference Friday, Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick, R-Union,\u00a0said he doesn\u2019t think Democrats will make any substantive changes to school funding. \u201cI think it\u2019s too much of a hot political potato in their caucus,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut the Democrats have a duty, in my judgment, if they want to address property tax relief, to at least come up with some plan that redistributes some of the funding,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe know that one-third of our budget goes to the school fund, and you\u2019re not ever going to affect property tax relief in this state, or lower property taxes, unless you at least address school funding.\u201d\nStaff Writer Dustin Racioppi contributed to this story.

GOP Congressman MacArthur votes no on Obamacare repeal\nKeldy Ortiz , Staff Writer, @keldyortiz Published 8:03 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 | Updated 6 hours ago\nCongressman Tom MacArthur\n(Photo: 2014 AP file photo)\nWhile U.S. House members on Friday overwhelmingly passed a vote to start in motion the repeal\u00a0of the Affordable Care Act, Rep. Tom MacArthur was New Jersey's\u00a0lone Republican to say no.\nMacArthur of the state's 3rd District \u00a0was one of nine Republicans who voted no, in a final vote of 227-198. No House Democrats voted for the repeal. The vote set forth the motion to repeal\u00a0the program known as Obamacare.\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump at a press conference\u00a0had\u00a0vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\"Both parties have missed opportunities to fix our health care system \u2014\u00a0one of the greatest priorities of our time \u2014\u00a0and now we're faced with an Obamacare system that is literally falling apart,\" MacArthur said in a statement.\u00a0\"Skyrocketing premiums, disappearing insurance plans and out-of-control deductibles are failing the American people. I lost today, but I will keep fighting to carefully, rather than quickly, replace Obamacare, and make sure that all Americans can buy the health insurance they need and that nobody has the rug pulled out from under them.\u201d\nThe vote against the repeal by MacArthur, who took office in 2014, contrasts with the position of Democrat John Adler , who represented\u00a0the 3rd District until he died in 2011. Adler\u00a0voted against Obamacare when he was elected to Congress.\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jGitzJ\n"]]
