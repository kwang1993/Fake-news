I know everyone has their crazy stories and thinks they are all terrible and I'm sure you have heard worse, but this ones a real kicker.\nWe met in college and dated for about a year and a half. When we first started hanging out he told me he had an older brother die in a car accident while he was in high school. He lied. The whole time we dated he let me believe this about him and feel sorry for him. He always added to the story and I always thought something was funny about it but why would someone make up such a horrendous lie? It was a touchy subject so I never brought it up to anyone else. One time when I was visiting his hometown he took me to the \"place of the accident\". He proceeded to always add to this lie by telling me stories about him and his \"brother\" from when they were young.\nThe whole year and a half he proceeded to put me second all the time to his friends because drinking on the weekends was more important. I am not one to go out drinking like he was. Everyone told me they saw I wasn't happy but I thought I loved the guy. We would talk about the future and how we wanted the same things in life.\nWhen we broke up he told me he needed time to just figure himself out and be him for awhile; he didn't want to drag me around while he did that. He wrote me a sappy letter telling me how he will always love me and that he knows he has to do this now so we can have a future together. A month later was when I found out he lied about some other things so I asked about his brother because my curious mind couldn't find an obituary, news article about the accident, or anything. He said he had no idea why he made up this huge lie. I also found out he told his girlfriend before me the same exact thing.\nWell, it has been almost a year now since we broke up. He is dating someone new and I've been talking to a new guy but I feel like my past is holding me back from the relationship I deserve with this great guy.\nAt this point I'm not sure what to do anymore. I know my ex boyfriend is a dick and I should stop thinking about him, but it seems like I'm forever hung up on him.\nPlease any advice can help,\nForever Hung Up\nDear Forever Hung Up,\nYour letter is not about your ex being a dick. If he were a dick, you would have stopped thinking about him by now. But you are thinking about him. Almost a year later, and you're reaching out to me, too. You said you shouldn't be thinking about him though. Has someone told you that? Often our friends do.\nThey reiterate that you've gone through something lousy and asinine, something unfair and wrong. They call him a liar which makes you suspicious that maybe even his love for you was a lie, that it was obviously a lie. Of course, you were already thinking that but now your friends have just escalated this self-consciousness and now you just feel smaller and even more overlooked by even more people that you've let come close to your heart.\nMy god, you haven't even experienced real love! You know nothing! Has the enemy within you told you this before? I bet. I bet you feel cheated out of your own romance, your own feelings, the deep and sacred emotions of your life. You fear for yourself, for the foolish side of you that falls for these dicks, these sociopaths, these spineless liars so unlike yourself but who are very much your ex, and then you fear for the courageous side of you, too. The compassionate side. The side of you that falls in love with stories, even though those stories are lies, the side of you that falls in love with wounds, even though the wounded has created those wounds to cover up the ones that not even he has the heart, let alone the courage and compassion, to get close enough to to understand, to make peace with and resolve.\nBut that's because of his own intimidation, and his intimidation should not create in you a fear that did not exist before. Actually, should is the wrong word. You've already told me you should stop thinking about him. And, in my opinion, that's already one should too many. So, I'll take my should back and I'd like to challenge you to do the same for yourself. Give yourself permission to think about your ex, be it a long time or a short time, think about your relationship with him for however long it takes to think deeply enough. Because, here's the thing, whether his intimidation should or should not create a fear in you matters little. It matters little when the reality is his intimidation, the wounds he has and the lies he's used to guard himself against his own hauntedness, can create fear and insecurity and suspicion in you, and the point of you reaching out to me and my reaching back to you is the same: we must relieve you of this transgression. More than greater love with this new man of yours, you deserve to have a spirit unencumbered by lies and shoulds and the shameless deceit inflicted by a single man. Or, in this case, a sad sack.\nSo, let's start there. Your ex is not a dick. Dicks can be forgotten. Your ex has been someone you've had to endure. He's a sad sack, an inept person who causes feelings of pity or disgust in other people. You are disgusted that you have looked dreamingly into the eyes of a man who has taken you to the faux death site of his faux brother. That's disturbing as much as it is disgusting. To be sure, your relationship started with--and quite possibly, in his mind, was sustained by--pity for him. Pity that his brother died. Pity that his brother was plucked tragically from this earth. Pity that, now brotherless, he feels more alone in this world. Pity that he's a man who could be haunted by events and the emotions attached to them, a man who's grieving and therein should be given both the support and space from you, his faithfully understanding and patient girlfriend, whenever he should need it, whenever he should call upon you to adore him or push you aside so he can chug beer and forget his pain like any grieving young adult would want to.\nI realize the seesaw of emotions this would have created in you. As a young woman, it's difficult enough to know your place in the world. Add to that knowing your place in your boyfriend's life--a boyfriend who is, supposedly, surviving the devastating loss of his own blood. How much love can you insist upon? How much closeness makes sense with someone who's impulse will be to cling in one moment and fear you in the next? If I were you, I very likely would have manically reasoned away his \"putting me second all the time\" by telling myself that, of course he is! He's grieving! Of course he needs me and then wants nothing to do with me! Of course, of course, of course! Because that's how humans behave when they've lost anyone for the first time. They sabotage anything that comes along and looks like love, that comes along and feels like home.\nMaybe you felt a little bit like love. Maybe you felt a little bit like home. You must have because for a year and a half he not only kept up a lie, but added to it. And that's why love is so bittersweet. We feel at home when we are with it. We get comfortable and a new normal becomes us.\nYou see, the best of us will relax into this comfort, put down our shields and weaponry, and will discover ourselves with the person who has aided us in accessing this newfound freedom. But the worst of us will not do this. The worst of us will get comfortable being the worst part of ourselves. We will feel so comfortable lying that we will eventually forget our own truth, and we will forget why it is so needed. We will forget where the lie ends and we start. And so, out of our own forgetfulness, the lies won't stop and we won't ever really start. The deceit will only compound. Because what's comfortable, inevitably, becomes second nature. At least, we want it to. That's why your ex has carried his lies into all of his romances. Because he wants to exist in what he already knows he can control.\nHe uses faux pity to control how fast and in what nature his relationships evolve. He uses faux pity to also direct the attention toward him in some cases and off of him in others. He is in lust with convenience. How sad. How chaotic. How unsustainable. Genuine attention has probably never, ever come easily or naturally for your ex. Which speaks to why anyone would ever possibly want to grow comfortable in their own deceit, comfortable in making honest love impossible. Because deceit relaxes them from having to learn and then admit to who they really are which often feels like the admission of everything they are not. This is what your ex is up against. He's up against all he has never exposed, which is most of him. He's up against a world he has never lived honestly in. It's a good thing you aren't sharing in his world any longer.\nI want you to see your ex for who he is because that insight will facilitate your distancing yourself from him in your mind. It's how you will separate the love you are able to give from the love you have only received. If you see yourself as an innocent participant in this story of yours, if you see yourself as a woman who was only wanting to love, who was only trying to make life easier for a man who had already experienced so much pain, then you are a valuable, gifted woman. Men will yearn for your substance. Women will admire your abundance. You will help people come into love. That is, if you remain willing to give it, to open up and invest your heart again. Not just in boyfriends but in people.\nRight now you are a woman moving through the world naive to all the love, all the potential for connection, that's being carried within her. This is the perfect moment in your life to finally begin acknowledging yourself, to finally begin thinking, not of your ex and his capacity to lie, but of you and your capacity to love with truth. Tell me, how will you compliment yourself today? Tell me, what impresses you about yourself? Think of it. Write it down. Say it aloud. However you do it, just make sure you begin to. Make sure you begin to thank yourself. Make sure to treat yourself good.\nBecause you may have been with your ex, but you are not him. You do not do what he does. Celebrate that. Celebrate. And whenever you are hurting, remind yourself of the difference between the best of us who relax into love and the worst of us who relax into self-hatred. Acknowledging the camp you're in is a reliable way to cheer yourself on and cheer yourself up.\nWe have to acknowledge what this is all really about though, to acknowledge why this drama has been imposed upon your current relationship and is limiting it, too. The reason is, what you're hung up on is not what you think you are hung up on. What's holding you back is not who your ex is or what your ex did. It's not the memories of him, the memories of his faux pity or even your genuine love. What's holding you back is all that's gone unacknowledged. Unrealized. What you're hung up on is not who he turned out to be but who you've turned out to be because of this experience, because this is now apart of your psyche, apart of your reality, your radar, story, and life.\nMost people in your situation would think they were coping with the loss of a boyfriend, of a breakup. And in small ways, they are. They've lost a friend, a confidant. They've lost that future that you wrote me about. The talks about wanting the same things in life. You've lost the vision of where your life was headed. You've lost that and you've lost the idea of who you thought your ex was and who you imagined he could be once he had healed from the tragic lie he held over you and convinced you of. Those details are the smallest details, and they are the ones you are focusing on, the ones you are making into everything and fighting the acceptance of. This is why you haven't healed yet, this is why you are still held back by a boyfriend you seem \"forever hung up on\". Because you are not standing up to the biggest loss of all. You are not grieving the reality that haunts you most.\nThis is your reality: You've lost your innocence. That's what lies strip us of. That's what boyfriends who lie strip us of. They strip us of our own beautiful naivety. Our own beautiful fantasy. The fantasy that no one is out to fool us. The fantasy that no one can fool us, either. Lies change us in this way. They shatter and transform us. They take believers and turn them into skeptics. They turn trusting people into distrusting people. Paranoid people. People that erect walls and barricades around their heart and go on to never let love in without resistance. Good people give up on people like that. It's too much work, too much drama, too much distress and self-doubt. That's what disbelief really is. Suspicion turns into self-doubt. Good hearted people like you want to be surrounded by those who don't doubt--don't doubt others or themselves. Good hearted people like you want to find those who are accepting. Think about it, if your ex were actually accepting of himself, these lies would never have been fed to you in the first place. By the way, I'm sorry that they were.\nBut it's not the end of the world. It's only the end of love as you know it. That's another reason to celebrate. If you lean in wisely, love will only go up from here. You have choices right now. You can begin having the conversation that your friends have probably helped you shut down. A conversation no longer about your ex being a liar and a dick or how untrustworthy men can be and how doomed you are but, a conversation that gets to the heart of the matter, that reveals what this breakup has provoked in you, what this deceit has stripped you of, what questions this relationship has made you vulnerable to. Like, are you afraid you are a woman who is easy to fool? Angry that you are a woman who now doubts every story she hears? Who plays CIA agent and manically fact checks a person's life? Have you lost faith in yourself? In your capacity to hunt down the gems of the world? Are you disappointed in your own willingness to overlook those \"funny\" feelings early on, those gut stirrings that say step away from this red flag of a person right now?\nI have promising news. Don't be so afraid. This is one relationship. This is one liar. You will meet others and you will not meet them, too. You will learn to trust yourself early on and to forgive yourself for falling into relationships that then complicate the romances which come after them. Don't be mean to yourself about this, about the tangles your mind gets tied up in, about the people whose behavior trips you up and, in most instances, was and always will be beyond your control. You are learning. You are discovering. You are doing what we all are doing as we find our way into greater love. You are getting overwhelmed by those who fall in and out of your life, by the relationships which shake you and your understanding of love at the very core. In truth, it's better than not being shaken at all. Again, this is your time to be growing through love. To let love in, you'll have to accept that you'll be plunging toward growth.\nI'm going to tell you something, something that will keep you open and keep you trusting and keep you from becoming the bitter, broken, cynic of a woman that you do not want to become just because this experience with your ex. For my message to work though, you've got to believe it. You've got to practice it. Here it goes. Men are not the problem. Certain people become our problems. You have your entire life in front of you, don't let suspicion ruin the romance of it.\nWhen you think of your ex, it's okay to think of him as a liar. As a sad sack. But make sure that instead of only reminding yourself of him, of that, you remind yourself of what you felt at times with him. Remind yourself of the moments where your trust was powerful, where your heart was compassionate, where you felt that maybe you were being tricked but you chose to risk yourself, where you chose to give someone a chance. More than being fooled, you have been brave. And that's all been you. Liars cannot strip you of that. They may shake you up but you've got bravery in you. You've got trust and intuition. And you will be brave and you will be trusting again. You will trust in men and you will also trust yourself, that you have the instinct to know who is relaxing into their best selves and who is too comfortable living through their worst.\nYou do know what to do. You just have to let this fallout change your life. You have to let this deception inspire you to never be the deceiver and to never engage love in a way that is half alive. You have to put aside the bad guys and love with all the goodness you have inside of you. You know how to do that. Go do it. Then, do it again and again and always one more time.\nFear less, love greater,\nChelsea\nA Breakup Coach trained and certified in Solution-Focused Life Coaching, Chelsea Leigh Trescott writes for publications such as Thought Catalog, Elite Daily, and Mend.

Contact him at kellym@northjersey.com.\nTHE FIRST DRAFT of history can be embarrassing to take back and rewrite, especially when it has the appearance of legitimacy. Let\u2019s hope Chris Christie knows that.\nLess than 100 days ago, amid revelations that his aides and allies orchestrated traffic-snarling lane closures at the George Washington Bridge as political retribution, Christie called for an internal investigation. He hired one of America\u2019s top law firms. The bill is expected to exceed $1 million.\nIn case you wondered, Christie is not picking up the check. New Jersey\u2019s taxpayers are. And that is precisely why the report on that internal investigation, released last Thursday, is worth studying.\nThe sheer weight of the report \u2013 344 pages \u2013 is noteworthy. So is the scope of the alleged research. The report describes \u201cinterviews with more than 70 witnesses and the review of more than 250,000 documents, including the personal texts and emails of the governor, the lieutenant governor and their senior staffers.\u201d\nSeems impressive, no?\nA dozen lawyers\nThe investigative team included 12 lawyers from the New York-based law firm, Gibson Dunn. Five of those lawyers are former federal prosecutors, including one who led a complicated investigation into a hedge fund and another who specialized in organized crime.\nChristie reportedly turned over his iPhone to be examined and allowed investigators to go through his phone records and read his personal and government emails. Other high ranking gubernatorial staffers apparently followed suit \u2013 some reluctantly, the report said.\nIn the end, however, the investigators reached a conclusion that should alarm reasonable skeptics: Christie played no role in the lane closures, which created paralyzing traffic gridlock in Fort Lee for four days last September, including the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\nThe report also said \u2013 incredibly \u2013 that Christie\u2019s office did not create a \u201cculture that encouraged aides to target political enemies.\u201d Christie\u2019s critics must surely be laughing at that one. This is, after all, the same governor who told journalists to \u201ctake a bat out on\u201d state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, the Teaneck Democrat, who happens to be a grandmother in her late 70s.\n\u201cGovernor Christie\u2019s account of these events rings true,\u201d the report goes on to say. \u201cIt is corroborated by many witnesses, and he has conducted himself at every turn as someone who has nothing to hide. We uncovered nothing contradicting the governor\u2019s account.\u201d\nSuch is the bold conclusion at the center of the report. But such boldness is framed by an all-too-obvious set of holes.\nKey figures not interviewed\nThe million-dollar team of lawyers did not interview the four\nkey players at the center of the lane closure scandal \u2013 Bridget Anne Kelly, David Wildstein, Bill Stepien and Bill Baroni. All declined to cooperate.\nSo did two key Democratic mayors who accused the Christie administration of the kind of pressure that bordered on extortion \u2013 Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee and Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken.\nSokolich told this columnist last month that he was pressured on several occasions to join other Democrats in endorsing Christie\u2019s reelection. He refused to endorse Christie and claims the lane closures were punishment. Zimmer says that Christie\u2019s lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, warned that her city may not receive as much Sandy relief aid unless she pushed through approval of a Hoboken development whose lawyer had ties to the governor.\nYet, without speaking to Sokolich and Zimmer or reviewing their records, the report nevertheless goes on at great length to discount their claims.\nMeanwhile, Kelly (who is not related to this columnist) comes off as a combination Cruella DeVille and Madame Defarge. Her emails portray her as conniving and callous, and at one point, as trying to cover up her actions by asking a staffer to delete an email that links her to the lane closures.\nPersonal revelation\nThe report also claims that Kelly had \u201cbecome personally involved\u201d with Stepien, her former supervisor in the governor\u2019s office who became Christie\u2019s campaign manager. But by early August 2013 \u2013 a month before the lane closures \u2013 \u201ctheir personal relationship had cooled, apparently at Stepien\u2019s choice, and they largely stopped speaking.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the point of this revelation?\nIt is surely juicy, though it\u2019s not clear what \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d actually means. Is it a friendship? A sexual affair?\nThe report does not say. But as any good defense lawyer knows, even the hint of sex is a great way of sullying an opponent\u2019s image.\nBut that kind of tactic raises an important question about the report\u2019s motive. Is this report an objective, tax-funded explanation of the lane closures? Or is it really a defensive memo for Christie\u2019s public relations team that clearly has its eyes on a possible presidential campaign in 2016?\nIf the report is really an objective look at the lane closures at the world\u2019s busiest bridge, what is the relevance of Bridget Anne Kelly\u2019s \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d to Bill Stepien? The report does not say.\nI mention this because at first glance the report seems professional \u2013 just like an academic account of a historical event. It contains 66 pages of 1,414 \u201cendnotes,\u201d for example, and gives the impression that it should be taken seriously.\nBut consider the conclusion that Christie\u2019s account of his lack of involvement or knowledge of the lane closures \u201crings true.\u201d There is no endnote of corroboration.\nNor is there an endnote to corroborate the \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d between Kelly and Stepien.\nJunior high term paper\nSuch conclusions would surely be challenged in court. They might even be challenged if this were a junior high term paper.\nBut in the end, the report gives Chris Christie exactly what he needs. It purports to seriously address serious legal, governance and political problems. But it\u2019s really a public relations document, dressed up to look like legitimate history.\nWhen you peel back the edges, there are too many blank spaces.\nThat\u2019s often the problem with a first draft of anything.\nBut most first drafts don\u2019t cost $1 million.\n"]]

For two tickets, that\u2019s an additional $25.\nTicketmaster is a little better, with a $9.50 service charge per ticket, and no handling fee.\nThe offer also comes with an option to upgrade to a better location \u2013 the seats in the basic deal are not the best \u2014\u00a0for $20. That\u2019s $20 for each ticket, or an additional $40.\nIf you can accept that you\u2019re not really getting into the theater for half-price, you can save some money.\nSeat locations and availability vary greatly from show to show, but to get a sense of the landscape, I randomly picked a single night, Jan. \u00a026, and checked out the options for four productions: three musicals, \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812,\u201d \u201cWaitress\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera,\u201d and a play, \"The Front Page.\u201d\nThe best deal I found was for \u201cWaitress.\u201d Decent, if not great, orchestra seats \u2014\u00a0 toward the rear, in row M, about mid-center of a side aisle \u2014\u00a0were $75.50 apiece, or a total of $151 ($170 with fees), for locations full-priced at $149 a ticket.\nAt \u201cNatasha, Pierre,\u201d there were no orchestra or front-mezzanine seats available. Seats toward the front of the rear mezzanine were $60.50, instead of $79.\n\u201cPhantom,\u201d which will celebrate its 29th anniversary Jan. 26, had a pair of orchestra tickets for $139, but they were way back in row T. (The regular price for these seats would come to $274, and if you can find anyone who\u2019d pay that for a bad location to a musical that\u2019s been running nearly 30 years and has a plenitude of available seats most nights, you can also offer him the Brooklyn Bridge.)\nA much better deal for \u201cPhantom\u201d would have been going for an upgrade: two seats in row E, five and six seats off the side aisle, for a total of $187.\n\u201cThe Front Page,\u201d a very tough ticket when it\u00a0 opened last October, had two $147 tickets available for a total of $149, but the location, in a side aisle of row S, wasn\u2019t good. Much better was an upgrade to two seats midway down a side aisle in row K for $189. (The show closes January 29.)\nTo get started on your own hunt, go to the 2-for-1 offer at broadwayleague.com , click on the show(s) you\u2019re interested in and start browsing.\n***\nThere\u2019s a similar 2-for-1 offer for the annual Kids\u2019 Night On Broadway, which this year is Feb.\u00a028.

So the 53-year-old is\u00a0trying a host of ways to get that message across, sending (or hoping to send) it out via a just-released\u00a0book titled \"Curvy &\u00a0Confident\"; a soon-to-be launched podcast;\u00a0an in-development clothing line;\u00a0and a TV show that the blond, full-figured mother of one\u00a0is\u00a0hoping to launch this year.\n\"It is so important,\" says Emme (pronounced like Emmy),\u00a0sitting at one of her favorite local restaurants,\u00a0Sear House in Closter, wearing a hot-pink\u00a0sweater\u00a0and no makeup. (For the record, Emme says she has had no work done on her face or body; she wears a bit of makeup at times and she colors her hair. \"That's it.\")\u00a0\u00a0\"Women beat themselves up hating their bodies. But no one's body is better than any other.\"\nEmbrace your body\nEmbrace the body you were born\u00a0in, urges\u00a0Emme, the first plus-size model to be named one of People magazine's \"50 Most Beautiful People,\" in 1994 \u2013 and then again in 1999.\u00a0\"If you're constantly hating your body, what kind of life are you going to have?\"\nTo inspire women to stop bashing their figures\u00a0and consequently themselves,\u00a0Emme and her two co-authors for \"Curvy &\u00a0Confident\"\u00a0asked women to submit not only their negative-body-image stories but, more important, tell how they learned to feel good about their curves. Hundreds of submissions poured in.\u00a0\"It's very powerful stuff,\" says Emme.\u00a0They used 101\u00a0stories.\nEmme\u00a0has\u00a0told her story often. Born in Manhattan, she was raised by her mom after her parents divorced.\u00a0Her mother remarried when she was 5, and the family moved to Saudi Arabia. Emme's\u00a0mother and stepfather, she says, were severely overweight\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and her stepfather was obsessed not only\u00a0with his weight but with hers.\nHe'd weigh her every week. (\"It was horrible. I'd be so nervous.\") He'd\u00a0carefully watch what she ate. If Emme\u00a0wanted a second sandwich for lunch, her mother would have to ask her father for permission.\u00a0\"It was toxic,\" Emme says.\n\"I was never skinny. I was never going to be skinny. I was always big. But I was never fat,\" she says. \"I\u00a0love food. I love to eat.\" But thanks to her stepfather, she says, she obsessed about food, worried she'd get fat, too.\nEmme's active lifestyle\nShe never did, because, she says,\u00a0she loves to be active. She says she was always athletic \u2013swimming, rowing,\u00a0and doing track and field. Today she takes hikes in the Boys Scout Camp in Alpine, swims at the Y, and snowshoes near her home.\nEmme got a full athletic scholarship to Syracuse University and, after\u00a0graduation, was a TV reporter. She also put distance between her stepfather and herself, and stopped being obsessed\u00a0about food. \"I eat whatever I want,\" she says. \"I eat dessert. I don't think it's sinful or decadent.\" But she doesn't overdo it. \"I eat healthy, and I don't eat once I'm full.\"\n.\n\u00a0(Photo: .)\nAt age 33, an\u00a0age when most models are considered washed up, she entered the field due to friends' urging,\u00a0and was a wild success. Not only because of her natural beauty \u2013\u00a0wide eyes, high cheekbones, dewy skin \u2013\u00a0but because she was so confident, so different. \"The media wanted to hear and see something different,\" she says.\nSo she spoke out. About the diet industry, which has a reported \"98 percent failure rate.\" (\"I mean, can you believe that?\") About the fashion industry for not making enough plus-size clothes. \"It's crazy,\" she says. \"Most women aren't a size 0 or 4. They're 12, 14, 16 and\u00a0up, and they don't make clothes for them.\"\nConsequently, she's going to start her own active- and leisurewear\u00a0line, called Emme Style ( emmestyle.com ). \"I'm not a designer,\" she admits. \"I'm a creative director. I'm a brand.\" Emme today is a size 16, up from\u00a014 when she modeled all the time,\u00a0\"but everyone gains weight with age, right?\"\nWith her alma mater Syracuse, she also launched an educational design program called Fashion Without Limits, which\u00a0promotes teaching fashion-design students how to make clothes for 12-plus-size\u00a0women.\u00a0\"Syracuse has had the program\u00a0for three years.\" Parsons, she says, has picked it up, too.\nEmme says she\u00a0is somewhat more optimistic about the younger generation, who she believes is more self-accepting. (\"That is beautiful.\") Plus, she notes, in the past few years, there has been \"a resurgence of curvy models \u2013 models also who are browner, darker. It's about time.\"\nBut her love-thy-body message is still terribly important, she says. \"My mission is to ignite the inner magnificence of each one of us,\" she says \u2013\u00a0and, with a laugh, adds:\u00a0\"It's huge, baby.\"\nDiscussion\u00a0\n\"Women for Women: Your Time Is Now\"\nWhat: A panel discussion with five\u00a0local residents, including Emme;\u00a0Caren Zucker, co-author of \"In a Different Key: The Story of Autism\"; Laura Blackmer, senior vice president of Sharp Electronics; Najiyyah Brooks, founder of Diva Zone magazine\u00a0and Najiyyah Brooks Ministries; and Stacey Faske, founder/owner of Nourishing From Within and Kale + Co.; and Amelia Duggan, editor of (201).\nWhen: Jan. 18 from 6 to 9 p.m.\nWhere:\u00a0The Terrace, 299 Paramus Road, Paramus.\nCost: $25 online; $35 at the door.\nFor more info:\u00a0 northjerseyevents.com/womenforwomen\n159 CONNECT TWEET 8 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2iozHE2\n"]]

A number of shows already premiered out of town to some exceptionally good reviews which is optimistic for both producers and theatergoers alike. All dates listed below are tentative.\nMarch\n\u201cSignificant Other\u201d about a young gay man who while looking for love spends a lot of his time hanging out with this female friends searching for the same is returning from a successful off Broadway run. Gideon Glick repeats his role as does Barbara Barrie and Lindsay Mendez.\nOpens March 2 at the Booth Theater.\nArguably, Tennessee Williams\u2019 finest play (certainly my favorite of his) \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d returns again after the last excellent revival back in 2013 starring a luminous Cherry Jones as the overbearing Amanda Wingfield trying to find a gentleman caller for her painfully shy daughter, Laura. This new production starring Sally Field and the exceptionally fine actor/director Joe Mantello opened to very positive reviews (a different cast)\u00a0 in Amsterdam back in 2015. The innovative director Sam Gold who gave us the rousing, sold out production\u00a0 of \u201cOthello\u201d ending its run on January 18 is directing what appears to be a\u00a0 minimalist production.\u00a0 Opens March 9 at the Belasco Theater.\nImagine a small Newfoundland town having an unexpected 6600 travelers arriving on 38 airlines. That is what happened back on the horrific\u00a0 9/11. Unable to land in the New York area they were rerouted. That is the premise of the new musical\u00a0 \u201cCome From Away\u201d which received lovely reviews out of town. The book, music and lyrics are by the Canadian husband and wife team Irene Sankoff and David Hein. It stars the terrific Chad Kimball who was sensational in the musical \u201cMemphis.\u201d Opens March 12 at the Schoenfeld Theater.\nI have seen three productions of Arthur Miller\u2019s excellent family drama \u201cThe Price\u201d always finding something new in this superlative play about estranged brothers who come to sell their recently\u00a0 deceased father\u2019s furniture. It boasts a wonderful cast headlined by Mark Ruffalo,\nTony Shalhoub and Jessica Hecht. Opens March 16 at the American Airlines Theater.\nThe amazingly talented playwright Lynn Nottage will have her off Broadway play \u201cSweat\u201d which I found riveting move uptown. This hard hitting play about=t blue collar workers in a town in Pennsylvania rightfully received excellent reviews. Not to be missed if you\u00a0 missed it at the Public Theater and definitely worth a\u00a0 second viewing.\u00a0 Opens March 26 at Studio 54.\nThe deeply affecting musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d with a gorgeous score by Claude-Michel Schonberg (music, lyrics and book ) and Alain Boublil (lyrics and book) was recently revived in a sold out London production and is arriving in New York. Loosely based on \u201cMadame Butterfly\u201d the original played over 4000 performances. Opens March 23 at the Broadway musical where it originally premiered back in 1991.\nApril\nThe Olivier Award-winning comedy \u201cThe Play That Goes Wrong\u201d about an \u201camateur university production that goes hopelessly awry\u201d had a sold out year at London\u2019s West End. It opens April 2 at the Lyceum Theater.\nThe whimsical French film \u201cAmelie\u201d has been turned into a musical starring Phillipa Soo (\u201cHamilton\u2019\u201d). It tells about a lonely waitress with quite the imagination taking solace in others\u2019 lives which prove more interesting\u00a0 than her own. Directed by the fine Pam MacKinnon it has music by Dan Messe, lyrics by Nathan Tyson and a book by the excellent Craig Lucas (\u201cPrelude to a Kiss\u201d). Opens April 3 at the Walter Kerr Theater.\nVictor Garber gave a perfectly over the top performance as a 1940 matinee idol in Noel Coward\u2019s charming \u201cPresent Laughter\u201d revived in 2010. It will now star Kevin Kline who has been away from Broadway far too long. This should be a custom made role for Kline impeccable acting. It co-stars the always fine Kate Burton. Opens April 5 at the St. James Theater.\nTwo towering figures of the cosmetic world Helena Rubenstein and Elizabeth Arden will be portrayed respectively by Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole in the new musical \u201cWar Paint\u201d with a book by Dough Wright and music and lyrics by Scott Frankel and Michael Korie. A clash of the divas? Opens April 6 at the Nederlander Theater.\nThe superb \u201cOslo\u201d which recently played at the smaller Mitzi Newhouse in Lincoln Center is moving to the larger Vivian Beaumont. This utterly fascinating three hour (never dull) play deals with the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO. Opens April 13 at the Beaumont.\nThe popular 1993 film \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d has been turned into a musical and premiered to glowing reviews in London. It will star the excellent and underappreciated Andy Karl playing the Bill Murray role. Music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (\u201cMatilda\u201d) with a book by Danny Rubin who wrote the screenplay for the film. Opens April 17 at the August Wilson Theater.\nPaula Vogel\u2019s superb new play \u201cIndecent\u201d beautifully directed by Rebecca Taichman had a very successful off Broadway run. This intriguing work deals with the real-life occurrence which surrounded the very controversial\u00a0 1923 Yiddish play \u201cGod of Vengeance\u201d about a lesbian encounter. The acting and staging were breathtaking when I saw it,\u00a0 so am eagerly seeing how it fares on Broadway. Opens April 18 at the Cort Theater.\nLillian Hellman\u2019s delightfully stinging \u201cThe Little Foxes\u201d is being revived with two luminous actors: Laura Linney and Cynthia Nixon who will be alternating the lead role of the dastardly Regina Giddens. Opens April 19 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.\nBette Midler. Need I say anything more? She is indeed will be playing the iconic character Dolly Gallagher Levi in a revival of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d\u00a0 It co-stars the always welcome David Hyde-Pierce. Besides being excited to see what she will bring to the role,\u00a0 I also cannot wait to see what the very gifted choreographer Warren Carlyle will create when one can not easily forget the spectacular original choreography by the late great Gower Champion. It anyone can improve upon the original it would be Carlyle.Opens April 20 at the Shubert Theater.\nRoald Dahl\u2019s charming \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d\u00a0 has been turned into a musical which opened in London about a young boy who along with others gets the chance to tour the chocolate factory of the eccentric Willy Wonka. The wonderfully talented Christian Borle (\u201cFalsettos\u201d \u201cSomething Rotten\u201d) plays Wonka. Opens April 23 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.\nBased on the last surviving member of the Russian royal family,\u00a0 \u201cAnastasia\u201d boasts a score by Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics) who gave us among other shows the glorious \u201cRagtime.\u201d The book is by prolific playwright Terrence McNally (\u201cMaster Class\u201d). It stars Ramin Karimloo from the recent production of \u201cLes Miserables\u201d and the always enjoyable John Bolton (\u201cA Christmas Story.\u201d) Opens April 24 at the Broadhurst Theater.\nJohn Guare\u2019s compelling play \u201cSix Degrees of Separation\u201d which deals with a true story about a young man\u2019s con game with New York\u2019s elite is being revived with the terrific Allison Janney and Corey Hawkins \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d Opens April 25 at the Barrymore Theater.\nThe energetic and pleasing \u201cBandstand\u201d which I caught last year at the Paper Mill Playhouse is coming to Broadway. The invigorating choreography is by the masterful Andy Blankenbuhler (\u201cHamilton\u201d)\u00a0 and stars the radiant Laura Osnes (\u201cCinderella\u201d) and Corey Cott (\u201cGigi.\u201d) Opens April 26 at the Jacobs Theater.\nThe very\u00a0 talented Lucas Hnath (\u201cThe Christians\u201d) has taken it upon himself to write a sequel to Ibsen\u2019s classic \u201cA Dolls House\u201d by calling it \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2.\u201d It stars the fine Laurie Metcalf who helped make \u201cMisery\u201d less painful to endure and the always satisfying and accomplished Jayne Houdyshell. Opens April 27 at the Golden Theater.\n30 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2jBtqmt\n"]]

After stints with legends such as the Jimmy Dorsey Band and the Harry James Orchestra, Longo started the Hollywood East Coast Band and performs mainly on the West Coast now.\nEast Coasters will get a chance to hear his 17 piece orchestra, complete with his famous horns section, on Jan. 27 at a fundraiser for the Lodi High School Music Scholarship Fund.\nLongo was born and raised in Lodi as Pasquale Pizolongo and was inspired to become a musician in eighth grade\u00a0in 1943. Longo played the clarinet and alto saxophone for\u00a0four years in the\u00a0high school\u00a0band and orchestra and continues with those instruments today.\nAfter graduation, he enrolled in the United States Marine Corp in 1948.\n\u201cWhen I filled out my application for the Marine Corp, they saw that I played the clarinet and alto saxophone in high school and they needed a clarinet player in the Second Marine Air Wing Band in Cherry Point, North Carolina,\u201d he said.\nLongo played at military and civilian ceremonies, formal concerts, community celebrations, parades, festivals, and public relations tours during his service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best duty I can ever get,\u201d said Longo about his role in the band. \u201cPlaying marches when you are marching down with a 70 piece Marine Corp band was very exciting.\u201d\nAfter the military, he attended college in California with a music major and joined up with legendary jazz bands out there.\u201cI was going to college and started playing with Latin Bands on the weekends,\u201d Longo said.\nIn 1972, Longo said he received a call from Lee Castle, the leader of the Jimmy Dorsey Band, for an invitation to play saxophone in the band.\nThen in 1975, Frank \u201cPee Wee\u201d Monte, the leader of the Harry James Orchestra, called Longo\u00a0as a fill in.\n\u201cIt was supposed to be only for one night because one of their saxophone players was in trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cHarry stood right in front of me for 45 minutes for the first set and at a break he had the manager tell me that Harry wanted me to join the band.\u201d\nLongo was part of the Harry James Band until 1978. That year he left Harry and started his own band - the Hollywood East Coast Band.\nPat Longo started the Hollywood East Coast Band in 1978\n\u00a0(Photo: Courtesy/Pat Longo)\n\u201cWe have played for Rod Stewart\u2019s wedding, played songs for HBO\u2019s \u2018The Sopranos\u2019 episodes, the Academy Awards Governor\u2019s Ball and many more,\u201d he said.\nOn Jan. 27, Longo\u2019s band will be collaborating with the Lodi High School Jazz Band to raise money for scholarships, with a $3,000 goal in mind.\nHigh School Band Director Julie Macri approached Longo about the fundraiser after Longo spoke to\u00a0one of her classes\u00a0at the school last year. Longo agreed to collaborate on the fundraiser, she said.\n\u201cI wanted to see what was going on with my alma mater after all of these years,\u201d said Longo about coming back to his high school.\nAttendees will also get to hear Hollywood East Coast Band vocalist John E. Booth. Longo said the evening will open with the Lodi High School Jazz Band, after which Longo\u2019s band will begin with \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d followed by standards such as \u201cSeems like Old Times\u201d and \u201cRhapsody in Blue.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s terrific that after being gone for so many years from his hometown that he is coming back in the autumn of his career to where it all began,\u201d said Booth, adding he is excited about the gig.\nThe event will take place at Lodi High School at 7:30 pm. Tickets will be sold at the\u00a0door with the cost of $15 for adults at $15 and $5 for students.\n60 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2itOM7s\n"]]
[["name", "new_1/189.html"], ["url", "http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/diane-sawyers-exclusive-interview-chris-christie-23092214"], ["text", "Video Transcript\nTranscript for Diane Sawyer's Exclusive Interview With Chris Christie\nexclusive. One-on-one with the two-fisted New Jersey governor, Chris Christie. The man at the center of today's headlines. A big, new report was released today, concluding Christie did not order those two lanes of traffic on a bridge to be shut down for political revenge. But there's a question because the report that exonerates him came from lawyers hired by his side. So, I sat down with Chris Christie, today, at his home in New Jersey, to ask about the report, the fallout, and if he's really still in the game for the presidency in 2016. You'll remember, on America's busiest bridge, for four days straight, drivers used to 30-minute commutes, were suddenly locked in 2-hour, 3-hour, 4-hour gridlock. Emergency vehicles delayed. Children in school buss. Desperate people making calls to 911. It's an emergency. Reporter: And then, we read text messages showing some of kit Ty's assistants seemed to be charteling because this was causing stress to a political adversary. And tonight, some of the people who wrote those e-mails have still not talked about what they said or did not say to governor Christie. One of them, deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, seen here with the governor. Another, a member of the port authority, David wildstein, rumbling about getting immunity. Until they do, the governor points out, this report clears him. This report says I had no knowledge of it before it happened. And nor did I authorize it or have anything to do with it. That's the truth. That's what I said on January 8th. Reporter: Does it make you feel clueless? Like what was wrong with me? Not clueless. But it makes me feel taken advantage of. And more importantly, I feel like I let people down by not knowing. Sometimes people do inexplicably stupid things. Reporter: Do you really believe they didn't do it because they thought that's what would please you? If you didn't know about it, they were going to try to please you? I can't get into what their motivations were. Except to say, that anybody who really knows me, that they believe that doing something stupid was please me. Reporter: You say stupid. Yeah. Reporter: You hear the 911 calls, this is not just about stupid di. Stupidity to abrasiveness, sure. Reporter: I want to say what everybody is saying about the report. Words used, whitewash, expensive, scam, that the taxpayers of New Jersey just paid for your lawyers to find you blameless. Why should the taxpayers be paying for this report? A few things. First off, these are not my lawyers. Reporter: But the law firm that you've been affiliated with in the past. You've been one of the partners. You were chosen by the office. Sure. There's probably a law firm in this area that I haven't had some interaction with after being the United States attorney. But bottom line is, these people have their own professional and personal reputations. Six of them are former federal prosecutors. They're not going to whitewash anything for me. Reporter: If Bridget Kelly talks, will she blow this report out of the water? Not credibly, no. Absolutely not. Reporter: You think she'll come after you? I don't see any reason why she would. Reporter: David wildstein has said that at a 9/11 event, he talked to you about traffic. It's a little ambiguous exactly why. Did he? I don't have any recollection of that, Diane. David is one of hundreds of people I spoke to that day. We sit around and spoke briefly that day. I don't have any recollection of him saying anything. But I'll tell you this, I'll tell you what he didn't say. He didn't say, by the way, governor, I'm closing down some lanes on the George Washington bridge to stick it to the mayor. Is that okay? That, I'd remember. Reporter: As you know, the word bully, bullying comes up over and over again. Have you asked yourself, did I do anything to create the climate in which this happened? Sure. I spent a lot of time the last 11 weeks, thinking about what did I do, if anything, to contribute to this? And I don't believe that I did. But I'm certainly disappointed in myself that I wasn't able to pick up these traits in these people. I'm disappointed in myself that I didn't look closer, that I didn't -- that I trusted too much. Reporter: You don't think there's a single possibility that they thought that -- in your rough-and-tumble style, in Jersey politics style, that they thought this would please you? No. Reporter: That this was for you? No. I don't believe it was for me. Reporter: Is this personal? I don't believe it was for me. Reporter: What did you say to your children? What did you say? Our oldest son was home on break. And he asked me, did you do this? It was a tough question, that your son would ask you. And I said, no, I didn't. And he said, good, I'm glad. Reporter: Ronald Reagan said that leadership is not just about doing great things yourself. It's about inspiring great things in every person around you. Did you fail your definition of leadership? Well, in this instance, I certainly -- this is not something that I think I inspired. And to the extent that any of them thought this was acceptable conduct, then I fell short. And I don't think that in the end, I obviously didn't make it clear enough to these folks that this kind of stuff was unacceptable. This is an abuse of the trust of the authority that was granted to you. And that's unacceptable. And no one, that anyone didn't understand that, believe me, from this day forward, anyone who works for me will understand that. Reporter: Is it a change of the leadership style? No. I am who I am. And for some people, they love it. And I will tell you, when I travel around New Jersey, I hear from most people, that's what they love the most. Reporter: And what about Iowa? I think they love me in Iowa, too, Diane. I've been there a lot. I think they love me there, too. Reporter: Has this torpedoed your 2016 run? Your 2016 chances? I haven't made a decision about 2016. And I don't intend to make a decision about 2016 until a year from now. But it has nothing to do with what happened in the past ten weeks. What happened in the past ten weeks, I think ultimately, will make me a better leader. Whether it's governor of New Jersey or any job I might take in the public or private sector. Reporter: Has this been the toughest time in your life? Toughest time in my professional life. Not my personal life. But toughest time in my professional life, sure. Sure. Reporter: What's the measure of that? Is that up at 4:00 in the morning? Or getting to sleep at 4:00 in the morning. Reporter: Yeah. You don't sleep. You don't eat. You -- you know, you struggle. Reporter: Were you at any point, thought maybe I'll step down? Maybe this is just too -- this is too much? Never. Never. Just not a quitter. And by the way, there are other investigations under way.

Attorney Leon J. Sokol also dismissed Stepien\u2019s argument that turning over documents would violate his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.\nThe court filing sets the stage for a critical decision by a Mercer County Superior Court judge who will hear arguments in court on Tuesday. Stepien and Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly are among dozens of people who have been subpoenaed by state lawmakers. They are also the only two who have refused to comply.\nThe judge\u2019s decision will either stunt the legislative investigation or allow it to dig more deeply into any documents that Stepien or Kelly may have that would shed light on the origin of the lane closures. It was Kelly who wrote to a Port Authority executive, \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d weeks before two of three access lanes to the bridge were shut, causing massive backups in Fort Lee, in an apparent act of political retribution against the borough\u2019s mayor.\nFederal prosecutors are looking into the lane closures.\nLawyers for Stepien and Kelly separately argued in court filings released earlier this week that turning over the documents would violate their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination because they are both the subject of a federal criminal investigation related to the closures. But Sokol wrote that Stepien\u2019s \u201cblanket refusal\u201d to turn over any documents was inappropriate and argued that a court should decide which individual documents the former campaign manager should be forced to turn over.\n\u201cUnder Mr. Stepien\u2019s interpretation of the privilege against self-incrimination, it is virtually impossible to imagine any government subpoena that could be upheld,\u201d attorney Leon Sokol, of the Hackensack firm Sokol, Behot & Fiorenzo, wrote.\n\u201cMr. Stepien cannot invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in blanket fashion to refuse to comply with the Subpoena in its entirety. Rather, Mr. Stepien is required to show this Court on a request-by-request and document-by-document basis why his invocation of the privilege is valid,\u201d Sokol wrote in a brief focused on Stepien\u2019s objections.\nIt was unclear Friday if the committee planned to file a separate brief related to Kelly.\nThe lawyer for the joint legislative committee acknowledged that Stepien\u2019s objections to the some of the subpoena\u2019s requests may be valid, but he argued that Stepien should be forced to turn over requested documents that clearly refer to the lane closures or phone calls to particular numbers and calendar entries that show meetings with individuals identified in the request.\nThe committee\u2019s subpoena initially asked for a broad range of documents related to the closures, but after discussions with attorneys for Stepien and Kelly, the panel said it would focus first on phone records and calendar entries, deferring other requested records until a later date.\nThe lawyer also hit back against claims that turning over personal communications would represent an invasion of privacy.\n\u201cThough some of the materials requested in the Subpoena may be emails from a personal email account or text messages from a personal cell phone, these are not private communications that touch upon the \u2018intimate aspects\u2019 of one\u2019s life. Rather, these are communications concerning an important matter of public business \u2013 the lane closures.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"]]

Social Entrepreneur. Bestselling Author. Helping people clear the cluttered path to the life we seek.\nEvan Zislis\nJunoWarriorChild\nMy daughter started taking martial arts when she was five years old. I think it\u2019s helped teach her confidence, self-discipline, and self-reliance. Life isn\u2019t always cream puffs and unicorns. When dire circumstances warrant acute awareness, hyper-focus, and rapid response \u2014 kids trained in resilience are far more likely to endure hardship and advocate for peace with poise.\nIn my family, we ain\u2019t raising no princess. We\u2019re revolutionaries and unyielding warriors of justice. We do our research. We know where our food comes from. We\u2019re intentional and informed with every purchase. We talk about environmental preservation, human rights and civil liberties. We look at labels and shop almost exclusively second-hand. We vehemently reject playground and corporate bullies seeking to profit on the backs of the little guy. In our house, we relentlessly root for the underdog and those doing the right thing . In our community, we show up with blood, sweat, tears, gluten-free chocolate chip banana bread, and baskets of homegrown organic veggies for those struggling to survive the day.\nAt our dinner table, no topic is taboo. We name the elephant in the room and promote discourse on all things controversial. We respectfully provide opportunity for everyone to express opinions, vet ideas, and workshop viable resolutions. When something makes the hair on the back of our necks stand up, we talk about it. We understand that safety is an illusion and control is a fairy tale; that on any given day, precious life is precarious, hanging in the balance like a feather on the wind. We reject hate-talk and dismiss fear-mongering. We embrace the practicality of living every moment \u2014 because life\u2019s too short to pretend it\u2019s not.\n\u201cEverybody dies\u201d is a common mantra in our home. Not for fear of death, but as a compassionate reminder that in life there is no permanence. Our soulful six year old has given elaborate burials to expired honey bees found in our garden, respectfully thanking them for their invaluable contributions and wishing them safe passage to future endeavors. Living an active outdoor lifestyle in the heart of the Colorado Rockies, she\u2019s become an avid student of wildlife biology, horticulture, and ethnobotany. True to her namesake, our astute Juniper is diligently learning the nuances of the food chain, life cycles, and the interconnectedness of all things.\nWe don\u2019t have television. Juno\u2019s exposure to clich\u00e9 Disney princesses has largely been limited to the fiery, redheaded archer Merida from the movie \u201cBrave.\u201d Our favorite bedtime stories are about hardship, adversity and redemption, where the heroine needs no rescuing. Books like \u201c The Paperbag Princess ,\u201d by Robert Munsch reveal protagonists\u2019 inner strength and self-determination we want to nurture in our own daughter. Parents looking for inspiration can check this great book list (for older readers) with female characters who promote the kind of bravery and perseverance we should all seek to cultivate from an early age.\nAs a professional organizer and author , it\u2019s my job to help people simplify, discover clarity, and become inspired by a rewarding life of purpose. You bet your ass my wife and I will be raising our daughter to be an independent thinker, a compassionate warrior, and a paragon of stewardship and integrity. Simon Sinek brilliantly reminds us, \u201cLeadership is not about being in charge. Leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.\u201d In my home, we\u2019re far from perfect and that means approaching every heart-felt effort with humility and a commitment to personal growth. Will Durant\u2019s famous interpretation of Aristotle states, \u201cWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\u201d\nAt six years old, Juno\u2019s well on her way to understanding that intentional habits grounded in compassion, generosity, and getting after it like a warrior \u2014 will reliably deliver hard-won results now and for the rest of her life.\nMore:\n"]]

I know that because I've either read or written a lot of it. But that doesn't mean my life is completely void of fear.\nLet me put it like this. Heavily airbrushed images give the illusion of perfection. In a similar way I don't want to 'Photoshop my words' and misrepresent what being a fearless woman actually means to me.\nAbove: One of my Facebook images about fearless living.\nAs someone who publicly speaks and writes about the word 'fearless' so much (and have had the word used to describe me), I thought I'd dig a bit deeper into the idea of being genuinely fearless.\nOn a 2015 trip to America, I metaphorically leapt over challenges and fears. I fearlessly wheeled around New York City, setting up an office (my laptop) in cafes and on park benches. I wrote a lot about the fearless lifestyle and how we can achieve it.\nThen on the second last day I found myself in a hospital emergency room. It's a long story but (for the sake of keeping this brief) all you need to know is that firstly, I'm ok now and secondly, I was absolutely terrified.\nAbove: From fearless (in a helicopter over New York) to fearful (in a US hospital bed).\nHospitals are never fun (and I've been in a lot !) but hospitals in a foreign country are extra distressing.\nTears and snot streamed down my face and I was definitely not pursuing a fearless lifestyle, at that time.\nOn my return to Australia (heavily dosed up with pain killers), an ambulance picked me up from the airport and took me to another hospital. As the medication wore off and my thinking became clearer, I began to contemplate what had unfolded over the last couple of days.\nOne minute I had been writing about fearless living and the next I was a fearful mess. Did this make me a fraud? Was I telling lies and writing fearless fiction?\nNot at all. I'm not contradicting myself - promoting fearless living and admitting that I have fears. I'm just being honest with you.\nThe great oxymoron: Fearless living\nAt first glance it would appear that fearless living is an oxymoron. Life is naturally full of challenges that instil fearfulness, rather than fearlessness in all of us.\nSo what does fearless living actually mean?\nOne of the easiest ways to define fearless living may be to start with what it is NOT. Fearless living is not living without fear.\nThe word itself is fear-less rather than fear-never.\nI want you to know that you can achieve a fearless lifestyle and still have moments of doubt, insecurity and fear.\nWhat other fearless females have to say\nIn her article about fearlessness, Terri Cole , a licenced Psychotherapist says, \"Fear is a feeling not a fact\" and I couldn't agree more.\nOn the odd chance that you are being chased by a large swarm of killer bees, this might not apply. But most often, our fears stem from a story that we tell ourselves (example, what will people think of me?), rather than fact.\nIn reality, people aren't thinking about you! They have their own interests and insecurities to occupy their time.\nBarrie Davenport lists letting of what other people think about you as a key component of living without fear.  She writes:\n\"You will never please everyone, and it is rarely worth sacrificing yourself to accommodate some other person's beliefs about who you should be or what you should do.\"\nIt's time to roar!\nI want you to know that it's normal for a fearless woman, like you, to have moments of fear and self-doubt. That doesn't make you a fearless failure, it makes you real!\nMy world is not perfect and I don't have it all together. Nobody does, no matter how 'together' their social media feed may look.\nAdmitting to fear is not being pessimistic, it's being realistic. The trick is for those moments to be fleeting, not ingrained in your life.\nHow?\nWell I'm so glad you asked!\nFor more on fearless living tips, download your FREE e-book here - Find Your Fearless - Simple Steps to Finding Fearless Freedom. It's the one I wrote in New York before I went into hospital.\nThat's the truth about being a fearless woman.\nLove life,\nLisa\nFor more from Lisa about fearless living (plus lots of other great content), you can join her here here on Facebook too.\nFollow Lisa Cox on Twitter: www.twitter.com/lisacox_co\nMore:\n"]]

Also, many\u00a0new cruise ports are being designed with accessibility in mind; ask your cruise agent in advance of your trip.\nBooking ahead:\u00a0 Reflecting the trend of their land counterparts, cruise lines are seeing a trend toward bookings further in advance \u2014\u00a0almost a year out, according to Cruise Planners. So if you\u2019re thinking of sailing, get on it.\nFirst look: Inside luxury line Seabourn's swanky new ship\nRedo, not\u00a0new: Cruise lines are refurbishing old ships rather than buying new ones. Examples: Holland\nAmerica\u2019s $350 million upgrade of entertainment, accommodations and dining fleet wide through 2018;\u00a0Norwegian is spending $400 million on its\u00a0Norwegian Edge\u00a0program, focused on raising the quality of dining, cabins and public areas across the fleet; Crystal Symphony is getting a major makeover this year;\u00a0and Silversea's Silver Cloud will transform from a cruise ship to an expedition vessel.\nPop culture themes:\u00a0 AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" and HGTV's \"The Property Brothers,\" have made a\u00a0splash in the industry, and Cruise Critic predicts there will be more of these themed sailings \u2014\u00a0fans love being able to rub shoulders with their favorite TV stars, personalities and musicians.\nSuite life: More lines\u00a0are offering an opportunity for exclusivity aboard their ships. Royal Caribbean International\u2019s new Royal Suite Class, for instance, not only includes butler service, but a dedicated concierge desk as well as special areas and a restaurant just for this premium cabin category.\nCarnival's private port, Amber Cove, offers a variety of tour options and activities.\n\u00a0(Photo: Carnival Cruise Line)\nPrivate ports:\u00a0Once just a novelty, it seems most cruise lines are now in the private-island business. The latest entry is Norwegian Cruise Line\u2019s newest port of call, Harvest Caye in Southern Belize, which takes advantage of \u00a0the world\u2019s second-largest barrier reef. Carnival Corporation is now sailing to a new port, Amber Cove, in the Dominican Republic, and guests can sip cocktails poolside, shop for souvenirs and rent private cabanas at this private port. By the end of the year, MSC Cruises will begin sailing to the new Ocean Caye, an exclusive 95-acre island in the Bahamas with an emphasis on cultural authenticity and marine conservation. MSC ships will dock overnight at the island, giving guests a chance to enjoy evening entertainment and nightlife.\nExpedition cruising: Celebrity Xperience and Celebrity Xploration will both begin sailing to the Gal\u00e1pagos islands, and \u00a0Lindblad Expeditions will position its new National Geographic Quest in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. And they're just the tip of the iceberg;\u00a0look for major growth in expedition cruising over the next five years.\nCruise bundles: Travelers are customizing vacations, paying in advance for\u00a0packages that, along with the cruise,\u00a0include pre- or post-stays, plus airfare, even the onboard Internet and a drink package. Less to worry about once you embark and shift into vacation mode.\nActive ashore:\u00a0Most river cruise lines now have bikes \u2014\u00a0passengers in port can go off on their own or use them for guided tours. Lines like AmaWaterways, Uniworld, Emerald and Scenic have hiking and kayaking tours. Meanwhile, Avalon has developed an entire Danube itinerary that focuses on active pursuits, and it plans to add a similarly dedicated itinerary on the Rhine next.\nAvalon's Active Discovery program on the Danube targets the trend toward more physical activities on shore excursions.\n\u00a0(Photo: Avalon Waterways)\nRedesigning for millennials: Trying to capture the attention of older millennials who have vacation time and disposable income, cruise lines have\u00a0begun turning their attention to more refined offerings like wine and food pairings, overnights with immersive port experiences, and decor that's decidedly less busy and more refined. Some new ships are designing\u00a0 cabins to look more hotel-like, even changing their wording to call their cabins and staterooms the more ambiguous \"accommodations.\"\n"]]

McGovern\u2019s rendition of the song \u201cThe Morning After\u201d from the movie was a freak runaway hit on AM radio that year, reaching gold status, going to No. 1 on the charts and receiving a Grammy-nomination for Best New Artist.\nThanks to \u201cThe Morning After,\u201d McGovern would go on to have another single from Allen\u2019s follow-up disaster movie, 1974\u2019s \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d with the Oscar-nominated song, \u201cWe May Never Love Like This Again.\u201d\n\u00a0From there, she would score another easy-listening hit from the first \u201cSuperman\u201d movie with her popular song, \u201cCan You Read My Mind?\u201d Even the movie \u201cAirplane,\u201d a satire of the disaster movie genre (specifically taking aim at the old \u201cAirport\u201d movie series) gives a nod to McGovern, who plays the singing nun onboard the aircraft.\nMcGovern hardly feels like she has to live down that unusual first chapter of her career. Quite the contrary. \u201cI am eternally grateful to \u2018The Morning After\u2019 and to the people who come up to me all the time and say that that song got them through a hard time in their lives, whether it was a divorce, or a disease.

These\u00a0are perhaps the most important outfits she will wear in the next four years, and the choice generally sets\u00a0the tone for what to expect from the first lady during her time in the White House.\nNo stranger to the spotlight, Melania Trump has perfected everything about her style, her smile, and what angles flatter her in front of the lens.

They are tentative and nervous, sometimes cowering behind your leg, using their small fingers to grip the edges of your shirt as they dare to peek beyond it.\nThe world is big and unknown, and they feel it. They sense its danger and volatility; the way the tide can shift under their feet. Understandably, they may be hesitant to dip their toes into it.\nThen there are the other kids, those who pummel forward, tripping over themselves in their haste to move faster, jump higher, and push through milestones like they were mere pebbles underfoot.\nLife seems easy for the fearless, with the way they drink from the cup of experience so fully, chugging one challenge after another, and receiving the admiration of parents, teachers, and peers in the process.\nSo we may assume that the fearful lose. That they miss out, too busy on the sidelines, fidgeting and squirming, to feel the warmth of victory.\nBut like any story, there is another side, one sometimes overlooked and forgotten.\nThis is the story where the fearful child wins, where they are the grand master and victor.\nLet me explain.\nI have 3 children, 2 of which are twins. The twins, Blake and Juliet, have been raised in the same environment and have shared experiences, caregivers, and pre-k classrooms. They've received equal amounts of love and care from my husband and myself, and each has been blessed with good health, intelligence and natural talents. And like any mother, I'll brag that they are unique and special in their own way, with quirks and big personalities that defy their size and age.\nYet, in one way they couldn't be more different. My daughter, Juliet, is fearless with an over-the-top Kanye West style of confidence. Blake is the opposite. He is tentative, careful, and wanting of support.\nFor quite a while, I started to believe that Blake was missing out. He sat on the sidelines while his sister danced onstage in front of hundreds, scaled a 40-foot climbing wall with her characteristic monkey grip, and skirted across the gymnastic beam with ease.\nHe watched as she made new friends at airports and restaurants, in lines and on sidewalks, formed teams of kids following her lead at local playgrounds and centers. As she set her eye on new mountains to climb and tasks to master.\nI wondered if Blake felt left out, like he was missing the train of wild fun she was on.\nBut then I noticed something interesting, and it all had to do with a yellow waterslide.\nWe were on vacation when we saw it. Constructed of twists and turns, the slide had a heavy current that sent its passengers flying out with a crash to the waters below.\nOf course, Juliet attacked it, pushing my helping hands away as she quickly ascended the stairs. I didn't even ask Blake if he wanted to go up since we had tried waterslides before with no success. Even if we reached the top, one touch of his toe in the slide, one glance at the fountain of water gushing from it, would cause a panic and retreat. Back down the stairs we'd go with the consolation that he'd tried, and perhaps we'd try again another day.\nBut this time was different.\nI'm not sure what came over him, perhaps it was the bright, clear sky of the Caribbean or the ambient sound of release that is only found in resorts. But Blake was finally game. He didn't panic as I sat him on my lap. Even if he was nervous, at this moment, his determination trumped fear.\nAnd what happened next was beautiful.\nIt took probably less than 10 seconds before reaching the bottom. But as we burst forth through to the water, he smiled wide and uttered some of the most beautiful words a parent can hear.\n\"I did it,\" he said. \"I really did it.\"\nThat slide, which wasn't much beyond a little fun to his sister, was so much more to him. It was his Everest. It was his fear, that thing he had just not been able to do before.\nIn just those few seconds, everything changed. Even at the young age of 5, Blake felt what happens when we face down fear.\nAs adults, we talk so much about our fears. We're hyperaware of their presence, like a black hat that presses down upon us, causing our spine to cave in underneath its weight. We argue and battle with it, and are often left with the bruises of what we could have done if only fear weren't in the way.\nBut it's different for a child. Of course, they're aware of that prickly sensation of fear, but for them, it's more of a sense than anything else, something they've yet chiseled down to a concrete form.\nThey might not know what to do with it, but they sure as hell know when they've overcome it.\nAnd when Blake saw his father just a few moments after leaving the slide, he ran with a skip in his step that seemed more buoyant than before.\n\"Daddy, daddy, I did the slide! I did the slide!!\"\nThe joy he felt at that moment, the joy that continued that day, seemed to seep into his bloodstream and carry forth with him. Because since then, he's gained a confidence that he didn't have before, the knowledge that what stands in his way now may not always, the experience of beating something that could've beaten him. Only on the other side of fear could he have witnessed this place.\nThis is what he gained from his fear. This is how he has won.\nFollow Amanda Richardson on Twitter: www.twitter.com/DrAmandaR\nMore:\n"]]

Contact him at kellym@northjersey.com.\nTHE Port Authority is obsessed with numbers. It counts cars and trucks at its bridges and tunnels, riders on its PATH trains \u2013 even gallons of paint needed to cover every girder and cable on the George Washington Bridge.\nBut here is a number that the bi-state agency ought to be deeply worried about: 16.\nThat is the number of comments from the general public on the Port Authority\u2019s plan to spend almost $28 billion over the next decade to upgrade its bridges, tunnels, airports and the PATH system. Those 16 comments came from nine people. An additional 20 comments were discovered by the Port Authority in various social media sites. It\u2019s not clear how many people actually made those 20 comments.\nChange needed\nBut one message is incredibly clear. The Port Authority goes about life in what seems to be a separate, unmonitored universe from the rest of life in the New York and New Jersey region. If the agency ever plans to reform itself, that needs to change.\nThe Port Authority\u2019s aloofness is not a new story. But the issue has gained renewed traction recently because of the lane closure controversy at the George Washington Bridge that not only threatens to undermine Governor Christie\u2019s second term but any possibility that he could emerge as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2016.\nAt the heart of that controversy is a question of abuse of power by Christie\u2019s aides and allies who allegedly orchestrated massive traffic jams in Fort Lee during four days last September as a way of punishing the borough\u2019s Democratic mayor for his reluctance to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection.\nOne of those allies, David Wildstein, was a high-ranking Port Authority executive, appointed by Christie. Without any oversight or even a hint of approval from anyone else in the Port Authority, Wildstein ordered the three access lanes from Fort Lee to the bridge reduced to one.\nTraffic backups\nThe traffic backups into Fort Lee\u2019s narrow streets took hours to untangle each day. Students were late getting to school. Commuters missed meetings in Manhattan. Emergency calls were delayed.\nSome critics such as state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, the Teaneck Democrat whose district includes Fort Lee, argue that such malicious gridlock would have never been allowed to take place if the Port Authority was more transparent. Maybe so. Certainly transparency within the agency\u2019s departments would have exposed Wildstein\u2019s ridiculous plan \u2013 what he called a \u201ctraffic study\u201d \u2013 before the traffic cones were switched.\nBut what about the agency\u2019s transparency to the outside world?\nThat question takes on even greater importance in light of the fact that the Port Authority attracted so few comments for its $28 billion capital plan.\nSome might argue that the blame lies with the general public. The Port Authority issues plenty of reports on its spending. Why won\u2019t ordinary citizens take the time to read them and comment? All they have to do is turn on a computer.\nThat\u2019s true. But that kind of argument misses an important point \u2013 namely whether the Port Authority could do a better job of being open.\nThe Port Authority\u2019s operations \u2013 its bridges, tunnels, airports and PATH system \u2013 are intimately connected to most people\u2019s lives. That was abundantly clear during last week\u2019s meeting of the Port Authority\u2019s board of commissioners.\nA variety of Port Authority officials discussed how the money in the $28 billion capital plan would be spent. As with most of the agency\u2019s professional staff, who are not political appointees, they seemed earnest, well-prepared and extraordinarily interested in improving the agency\u2019s facilities.\nAt one point Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye described much of the proposed work as \u201cblocking and tackling\u201d \u2013 a comparison to the basic work on a successful football team that often does not draw many accolades. Indeed, Foye\u2019s description was right on the mark. At its best, the agency operates the support system for millions of lives \u2013 the blocking and tackling that allows us to travel easily.\nHidden\nSo why is this kind of work so hidden from everyone?\nThe Port Authority operates as the equivalent of a government agency. But it does not even have to abide by the basic laws of New York and New Jersey that require openness in its meetings and record-keeping. What\u2019s more, its commissioners \u2013 notably Chairman Davis Samson, a close Christie ally \u2013 have not been required to disclose business and political conflicts. And even when commissioners acknowledge conflicts and recuse themselves from voting on contracts or other issues, they aren\u2019t required to offer an explanation right away to the public.\nIt\u2019s the kind of secrecy that might be common in private corporations. But the Port Authority is not General Electric. It gains its revenues from tolls at public bridges and tunnels and fees at public airports and subways. Its commissioners are chosen by elected officials.\nDuring a meeting last week of a new oversight committee, which was created to monitor the Port Authority\u2019s operations, Commissioner William \u201cPat Schuber, a Republican who served previously as Bogota\u2019s mayor and as Bergen County\u2019s executive, offered a gentle nudge to improve the agency.\nSchuber observed that the agency is too divided between New Jersey and New York interests. \u201cIn doing that,\u201d said Schuber, \u201cwe\u2019ve created a structure that creates two independent lines of authority.\u201d\nSchuber did not mention it, but a bureaucratic curtain separates those two structures and lines of authority. It\u2019s a curtain of secrecy.\nThat sort of secrecy allowed David Wildstein to dream up a \u201ctraffic study\u201d at the George Washington Bridge.\nTearing down that curtain might be a good start to reform.\n"]]

Help may be at hand via a new app based system developed by a team from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), in Israel.\nThe system is fascinating because it promises to help sufferers of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) whilst they are still awake, all from their smartphone.\n\"We've developed technology that could help diagnose OSA and sleep disorders in a convenient way,\" the team say. \"The audio-analysis application can record speech signals from awake subjects. Now, we will be able to get a fast, OSA severity estimation without an overnight sleep study.\"\nBetter diagnosis\nAt the moment, if you want to be accurately diagnosed for sleep apnea, you have to visit a lab where your brain waves, bloody oxygen, breathing, heart rate, and eye and leg movements are tracked as you sleep.\nThe new, app based approach, doesn't require any sensors, but instead utilizes the ambient microphone that is built into most phones.  The system then monitors your speech whilst you're awake, and then records your breathing as you sleep to provide a simpler and much less expensive means of diagnosis.\n\"All sleep studies conducted in laboratory or at-home settings currently require subjects to be connected to numerous electrodes and sensors,\" the team say. \"Processing the data on sleep-wake states and corresponding aspects of physiology is time-consuming, tedious and costly because of its complexity and the need for technical expertise. The market is begging for a better solution.\"\nThe system has been put through its paces on over 350 test subjects, where it was compared alongside more traditional, lab based testing.  The app based system was found to be as effective at evaluating a number of sleep quality parameters.\n\"We are excited about this non-contact sleep tracking system, which does not require patients to wear uncomfortable monitoring equipment on their body,\" the researchers conclude. \"This application can also be very useful for CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine users who want to check the effectiveness of their sleep apnea therapy.\"\nAs of the time of writing, the app still has some significant development work to undergo before it's fit for the marketplace, so for the time being my other half will have to suffer my snoring for a bit longer.\nFollow Adi Gaskell on Twitter: www.twitter.com/adigaskell\nMore:\n"]]

Democrats believe the closures were punishment meant for the Fort Lee mayor, a Democrat who declined to endorse Governor Christie for reelection.\nFoye, a New York appointee, asked that the agency\u2019s inspector general look into the reported actions of police officers stationed at the bridge, a source close to the Police Department said. Foye also asked that the inspector general notify the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Newark, which is conducting its own investigation of the lane closures. A separate legislative probe is also ongoing.\nOn Sunday The Record, citing motorists and Fort Lee officials, reported that Port Authority police officers at the bridge told frustrated drivers to contact the Fort Lee mayor or borough officials to complain. One motorist recalled that an officer approached his vehicle without prompting, told the driver to roll down his window and delivered that message.\n\u201cAre you frustrated?\u201d Robert Michel said the officer asked.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Michel replied.\n\u201cCall the mayor\u2019s office to complain,\u201d Michel said the officer responded.\nMSNBC also reported on Sunday that a police lieutenant stationed at the bridge exchanged text messages with David Wildstein, the Port Authority executive who ordered the closures, and drove Wildstein around on the first day of the closures to survey the back-ups. MSNBC identified Police Lt. Thomas \u201cChip\u201d Michaels as the person who told Wildstein in a text message on the first day of the closures that he had an \u201cidea to mak ths [sic] better\u201d and proclaimed on the second day of the closures \u201cLocal ft lee traffic disaster.\u201d\nUntil Sunday, the Port Authority police had been fringe characters in a controversy that largely focused on the Christie administration\u2019s top Port Authority executives and members of Christie\u2019s administrative and campaign staff. Bill Baroni, Christie\u2019s former top executive at the Port Authority, previously said that the idea for a traffic study at the bridge, necessitating the closures, came from the president of the Port Authority police union. Baroni has since resigned.\nPaul Nunziato, president of the union, was one of dozens of people subpoenaed by a legislative committee investigating the closures. Nunziato, whose union endorsed Christie, said before the lane closures became a full-fledged scandal that he broached the idea of a traffic study over a breakfast meeting with Wildstein. But Nunziato has remained silent since e-mails surfaced showing that a deputy chief of staff in Christie\u2019s office apparently ordered the closures with a message - \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d He declined through a spokesman to comment for the Sunday story in The Record.\nMichaels, the police officer who was the subject of the MSNBC report, and his brother have deep ties to Christie. They grew up with Christie in Livingston. The network reported that Michaels' brother, Jeffrey Michaels, is a powerful lobbyist whose practice has soared in value during the Christie years and who has donated heavily to pro-Christie organizations.\nIn previous testimony before the legislative committee investigating the closure, the bridge manager, Robert Durando made reference to an unidentified police lieutenant. Durando said that Wildstein came to the bridge on the first day of the closures on Sept. 9.\n\u201cHe [Wildstein] came to the facility on Monday morning,\u201d Durando testified. \u201cHe stood at the communications desk for a little while, it\u2019s an area with cameras to look out at the various roadways, limited view, albeit. He stayed there for a little while. He then left the facility, left the communications desk with a police lieutenant assigned to the George Washington Bridge, to ride around the facility for some period of time to see the impact on traffic.\u201d\nWildstein submitted documents in response to a subpoena that show he exchanged text messages that same morning with someone offering to pick him up in the parking lot of the administrative building at the bridge. The person\u2019s identity was redacted by Wildstein\u2019s attorney. Wildstein told the person he would be ready \u201caround 7:30.\u201d\nWildstein sent an email at 7:28 a.m. that morning to Durando informing him that he was leaving to \u201ctake a ride with Chip,\u201d apparently a reference to Michaels.\nOn the first morning of the closures, the person identified by MSNBC as Michaels also sent Wildstein a text message that stated \u201cits [expletive] up here.\u201d\nReports of motorists getting similar messages to call Fort Lee officials raised the possibility that police were part of a coordinated effort, one legislator said.\nAssemblyman John Wisniewski told The Record last week, \u201cIt appears that someone issued instructions or talking points.\u201d\nIn addition to asking the Port Authority\u2019s Inspector General to investigate, Foye also took the extraordinary step of requesting that the superintendent of the agency\u2019s police department, Michael Fedorko, not be involved in any review, the source said. It was not clear why Sunday night.\nThere was no immediate response to telephone messages left for a spokesman for the Port Authority and for Fedorko, who is already under two clouds at the Port Authority.\nHe is being looked at by the Internal Affairs office for his apparent failure to investigate an allegation of cheating in a promotional exam by a high ranking officer. And officers who have been hoping for promotion to sergeant are fuming that they were leapfrogged for the position by Fedorko\u2019s decision to give \u201cfield promotions\u201d to his two chauffeurs, who are now sergeants.\nFedorko, a wounded Vietnam veteran, retired in 1999 from the New Jersey State Police after a 31-year-career and then went on to serve two terms as acting chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. He was appointed superintendent of police/director of public safety of the Port Authority Police Department in July 2009.\nStaff Writer Jim Norman contributed to this article.

The former middleweight champion was more than his impressive boxing career, and so is this movie, according to Allegro, who had the idea for the film\u00a0more than 10 years ago. It looks at LaMotta's childhood and\u00a0boxing career, and at the interesting stories that came after he retired from the ring.\nAllegro\u2019s father knew LaMotta, who is now 95. A singer in the '50s, the senior Allegro hung around with other entertainers and big-time boxers of the day, his son said.\n\u201cI did research on it and I thought, because I had access to him, let me see what angle there is here with this,\u201d Allegro said. \u201cAs I dug deeper, I realized a lot of it is different [from \u201cRaging Bull\u201d]. \u2026 It didn\u2019t really do him justice. It wasn\u2019t the accurate story. It wasn\u2019t fully living up to the expectations of what his life was about.\u201d\nWith that, Allegro took the idea of a new LaMotta film to a friend\u2019s production company. When they said they were interested, Allegro went to his dad and asked if he could see whether LaMotta would be interested in doing it. They met over dinner in the Bronx \u2013 a scene Allegro said could have been part of a movie itself \u2013 and the legendary fighter agreed. With LaMotta onboard, the two scouted the Bronx for ideas on re-creating the neighborhood on sets in Hollywood, and the process began in earnest.\nJake LaMotta, now 95, and Haworth's Joe Allegro scouting a Bronx neighborhood.\n\u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of Joe Allegro)\n\"What was most interesting about the fighting in the '50s, it\u00a0was very\u00a0 much mob-controlled, and we showed that here,\" Allegro said. \"His whole life truly was running away from the mob. As much of a tough guy as he was and the image of not being an angel, he was very much not\u00a0into being controlled by anybody, especially the mob. They were always after him. They couldn\u2019t get him to do what they wanted him to do. To be a front guy for them on a couple of nightclub deals. To be a bouncer. To do this, make runs for them. He really was struggling right after he was fighting. He was a broke guy living in the city. He was always trying to find ways to make money, which is why he did his comedy life.\u00a0This was all sort of interesting stuff that never came out in the original movie.\"\n\u201cThe Bronx Bull\u201d is based on the book\u00a0\u201cRaging Bull II: Continuing the Story of Jake LaMotta\u201d by Chris Anderson. They shot it in 2012 on a Universal Studios lot with an ensemble cast that includes Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, Joe Mantegna, Tom Sizemore, Penelope Ann Miller, Cloris Leachman and Harry Hamlin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite an amazing cast for the budget,\u201d said Allegro, adding that the film was made for $7 million.\nSorvino plays LaMotta\u2019s dad, who used to send his son to the streets to fight other kids for money.\n\u201cHis father was a really mean guy, and Paul Sorvino nailed the role,\u201d Allegro said. \u201cIt\u2019s Academy Award [worthy]. It\u2019s worthy of tremendous reviews.\u201d\nThe cast, he said, took less money to be a part of this story.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a human journey and he\u2019s riding it out with his gloves,\u201d Allegro said. \u201cWe look at it psychologically instead of physically, although we have great fight scenes, tremendous scenes.\u201d\n245 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2ikmkVl\n"]]

He may be contacted at kellym@northjersey.com.\nON A SUNDAY in March almost two years ago, a group of Democratic legislators from northern New Jersey gathered near the George Washington Bridge to talk about reforming the Port Authority. Almost no one paid attention.\nThe issue at hand was not a traffic jam in Fort Lee. That paralyzing gridlock would not take place for another 18 months. And the looming presence of Governor Christie and his hardball political operatives was not even mentioned.\nBut that all-but-forgotten March 2012 meeting in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge may play a greater role in the coming months as the joint state legislative committee digs through the rubble of the Christie\u2019s Bridgegate scandal.\nWhat seems clear is that the much-anticipated hearings by the joint Assembly-Senate committee may not take place for months. And even if they finally materialize, some of the most significant players in Bridgegate may never speak a word.\nAlready three main characters in this strange narrative \u2013 former gubernatorial deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly, former Christie campaign manager Bill Stepien and former Port Authority executive David Wildstein \u2013 have cited their constitutional protection against self-incrimination and are refusing to testify.\nUnderstandable\nOthers may embrace a similar strategy \u2013 and why not? With federal prosecutors and the FBI examining Bridgegate and other allegations such as an alleged threat to withhold Sandy relief funds from Hoboken, it\u2019s entirely understandable that some of the main players would want to avoid testifying in public at a legislative fact-finding hearing. All those freely offered facts could then be scooped up by the feds to bolster an investigation or series of indictments.\nBut if possible hearings are a bust, does that mean the legislative probe of Bridgegate would be a failure?\nAlready, the Democratic leaders of that probe \u2013 state Sen. Loretta Weinberg and Assemblyman John Wisniewski \u2013 have anticipated such a problem. This is why the March 2012 gathering by Democrats near the George Washington Bridge may prove to be so important.\nIn March 2012, Democrats, including Weinberg, whose district includes Fort Lee and the George Washington Bridge, wanted new legislation to make the Port Authority more transparent and subject to some sort of oversight by the state Legislature. The concerns ranged from the lack of oversight on toll hikes and overall spending to an age-old Port Authority problem \u2013 the filling of patronage jobs with political loyalists.\nDemocrats charged that the Christie administration had filled dozens of Port Authority jobs with political pals, most of whom knew nothing about the agency\u2019s main tasks such as running airports, bridges, tunnels and a subway line. One of these new hires at $150,000 a year was David Wildstein, the former political operative and blogger who also worked in his family\u2019s carpet business. Definitely a guy who knew about trains, planes and automobiles, right?\nThe state Assembly and Senate passed legislation aimed at reforming the Port Authority. But you\u2019ll never guess what happened when it landed on Governor Christie\u2019s desk.\nLet\u2019s just say that Christie was not enthusiastic. But, already embarrassed by reports of his political buddies getting high-paying jobs, Christie looked for cover. He vetoed the bill, but offered a condition that he would sign it into law if the legislation included other reforms of other state authorities, too.\nThe result was that the legislation was stripped of its power. To reform the Port Authority, New Jersey and New York \u2013 the two states that control the agency \u2013 had to pass identical laws. The New Jersey law was going to be matched by another law in New York\u2019s Legislature. But with Christie saying he wanted other items in the law that were specific to New Jersey, the New Yorkers pulled out.\nAnd the Port Authority continued on its merry way of raising tolls, spending money without oversight and padding its payroll with political players like David Wildstein.\nWeinberg and Wisniewski are already hoping that their joint Assembly-Senate probe of Bridgegate will lead to some sort of reform of the Port Authority. And with the prospect that a variety of key players in Bridgegate will not testify before the joint committee\u2019s hearing, the Port Authority reforms are seen as a way to strike out in a different direction and achieve some sort of clear goal.\nNo surprise\nIndeed, Weinberg and Wisniewski told me in separate conversations that they were not surprised that their investigation may eventually focus more on the Port Authority.\n\u201cA lot of this has to do with the Port Authority and the fact that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any real overseeing being done there,\u201d said Weinberg. \u201cThat, to me, is one of the main things that needs to come out of this investigation. What should we be expecting from the Port Authority and who oversees that?\u201d\nWisniewski noted that the initial hearings by his Assembly transportation committee into Fort Lee\u2019s gridlock last September were part of a larger probe of the Port Authority and its recent series of toll increases. Now with the investigation being handled by a joint legislative committee, with Wisniewski and Weinberg at the helm, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to try to re-focus on the Port Authority.\n\u201cThe Port Authority \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this,\u201d Wisniewski said. \u201cSometimes it gets lost.\u201d\nThose expecting a Watergate-style set of hearings, with all manner of dramatic revelations, may be disappointed, especially with the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination seeming to be the new mantra of the Christie crowd. But in the end, New Jersey might just get something it really needs \u2013 more oversight of the Port Authority.\nSuch reforms won\u2019t be easy, say Weinberg and Wisniewski. It\u2019s hard to control a giant as large as the Port Authority.\nBut a mysterious traffic jam may just be the right way to start.\n"]]

But she apparently didn't have to wonder for long. \"She said she was so impressed by how eager they were to do this,\" Saunders said.\nSaunders is similarly impressed with McIntyre. \"She's a force of nature,\" she said. \"I watched her rehearse the company, take a break to go perform a 15-minute solo,\u00a0and then return.

Fans were rowdy, obnoxious. Things came to a head in\u00a0Montreal. Hooligans\u00a0were shouting disruptively, lighting firecrackers in the crowd, and otherwise throwing\u00a0Waters, David Gilmour, and the other musicians off their game. Finally, Waters had enough. He beckoned some poor sap in the crowd to come to the stage. \"C'mon, son, good boy, good boy,\" he purred. When the kid arrived at the lip of the stage, Waters spat at\u00a0him.\n\"He went back to the green room and said, 'We have to build a wall between us and them,'\"\u00a0Petit relates.\nLOCAL BAND: Chevonne and the Fuzz find bliss in hard rock\nThat was the genesis of \"The Wall\": the saga of an alienated rock musician, Pink, who walls himself off from humanity \u2013\u00a0his and other people's \u2013\u00a0with drugs (\"Comfortably Numb\") \u00a0and anger (\"In the Flesh\"). The 1979 album, with its keynote song\u00a0that became\u00a0the band's only No. 1\u00a0single, \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (\"We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control ...\"), ironically generated its own stadium tour, as well as a 1982 movie; a 1990 staged charity event,\u00a0\u00a0\"The Wall\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Live in Berlin,\"\u00a0to\u00a0commemorate the fall\u00a0of the Berlin Wall; and a 2010\u00a0tour by Waters, minus\u00a0Floyd: \"The Wall Live.\"\nThis new staged version, featuring nine performers (five musicians, four singers), is not\u00a0quite as over-the-top\u00a0as that last Waters tour, which featured state-of-the-art effects, giant puppets and \u2013\u00a0the kitchen sink \u2013\u00a0a gigantic wall that was\u00a0built, brick by brick, on stage as the show progressed. But \"The Wall Theatrical Extravaganza\"\u00a0still has plenty of visual razzle-dazzle, Petit promises \u2013\u00a0along with\u00a0some qualities that the big arena show may have lacked.\nA theatrical presentation of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\"\n\u00a0(Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\"For me it was a grandiose, humongous, Godzilla-esque kind of thing,\" Petit says. \"But the intimacy of the album and the story was lost. I wanted to create a show where all the songs from the album are being played \u2013\u00a0but we go deeper than that.\"\nAll of the music from \"The Wall\" will be faithfully rendered, Petit promises \u2013\u00a0along with a couple of interpolations, including \"Money\" from the \"Dark Side of the Moon\" album, and \"We'll Meet Again,\" the classic Vera Lynn wartime song that is only referenced on the 1979 album.\u00a0Such has been his\u00a0obsession to\u00a0detail, he's even gone\u00a0out of his way to get the exact model (1939) Mickey Mouse watch that is worn by Bob Geldof when he\u00a0played\u00a0Pink in the movie. \"I bought it for 500 bucks on eBay,\" he says.\nThere will be more than 25 costumes changes, Petit says, along with \"accessories and decor.\" Pink (played here at different points by\u00a0S\u00e9bastien\u00a0Lacombe and\u00a0Sylvain Auclair) will cavort\u00a0on a two-level stage with lots\u00a0of visual and lighting effects. No physical wall, though. \"The wall is in the mind,\" he says.\nWith or without \"The Wall,\" Petit (he plays rhythm guitar in the show) knows a bit about the downside of pop\u00a0success. He himself, as singer-songwriter, scored a hit in Canada in 2000 with his song \"Le Printemps\" from his album \"Kiss and Run,\" No. 1 in Montreal for six months.\u00a0But even before that, he \u2013 like millions of other alienated adolescents \u2013 could identify with \"The Wall.\" As a matter of fact, one of his formative experiences was uncannily similar to that of \"The Wall's\" hero, Pink.\n\"When I was 15, I was in class and I was writing poetry\u00a0and writing songs at\u00a0my desk and not listening to the teacher,\"\u00a0he says. \"One of those songs, when I was 16,\u00a0became the first hit of my career. When I saw the movie 'The Wall'\u00a0and saw Pink being bullied by his teacher, and the teacher takes his notebook, and the class is laughing at Pink, for me it was [familiar].\"\n\"The Wall Theatrical Extravaganza,\" which\u00a0began touring in February\u00a02016, is a project Petit has been nursing through five years and several different incarnations. \"It had three phases: a young infant phase, a teenage phase, and now\u00a0it's in its adult phase,\" he says.\nThe show, Petit says,\u00a0is neither a musical nor a tribute band,\u00a0but maybe something between the two. He'd be happy to think he created a synthesis that comes off\u00a0as well as \"Love,\" the Cirque du Soleil Beatles show that is one of his favorites. And why wouldn't it be?\n\"In Quebec, we're French Canadians,\" he says. \"Half of the artistic people in Montreal at one point or another have worked for Cirque du Soleil. It set the standard for everything that was done in Quebec. I've tried to do the same.\"\nMUSIC\nWHAT: \"The Wall Theatrical Extravaganza\"\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Friday, Jan. 13\nWHERE: The Wellmont Theater,\u00a05 Seymour St., Montclair;\u00a0973-783-9500 or thewellmonttheater.com.\nHOW MUCH: $20 to $65.\n60 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2iiQPLH\n"]]

Amelia Earhart chased her dreams. Albert Einstein saw the world with a childlike curiosity.\nIt\u2019s obvious why Brad Meltzer picked these heroes and others such as George Washington and Jackie Robinson when he began his Ordinary People Change the World series a few years ago.\nCompared to them, Meltzer concedes, choosing a puppeteer for the next installment of the series might seem as out of place as casting a diva-ish pig or insecure frog in his next historical-steeped thriller.\nBrad Meltzer.\n\u00a0(Photo: courtesy photo)\nThe best-selling novelist-turned-children\u2019s-author says that in a society where virulent discourse runs rampant across social media and in political arenas, this is the perfect time for \u201cI am Jim Henson,\u201d which went on sale Tuesday. The world could learn a few things from the man who created Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and others who inhabited \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show.\u201d\n\u201cEvery time I pick a hero, I pick a hero based on what I see my kids lacking today,\u201d said Meltzer, who will appear at the Barnes & Noble at 97 Warren St. in Manhattan to sign copies of \u201cI am Jim Henson.\u201d \u201cI look around today and we are just callous to each other. We have turned off to each other. We all attack each other freely because we all have our own Facebook, Twitter and printing presses in our pocket.\u201d\nSo why not tell the story of Jim Henson, who taught us to never get a laugh at anyone else\u2019s expense. Who said you should never stop being a do-gooder. Who heralded the ideals of inclusion and self-acceptance and couched and couched them in the words, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy Being Green.\u201d Who reminds us we should strive to make the world a place where, at least sometimes, sunny days are sweepin\u2019 the clouds away.\nOr as Meltzer put it, \u201cWe need to get back to the best things in life: Laughing, imagining, sharing, dreaming, creating.\u201d\nMeltzer has been doing a lot of those things for the past 20 years, since he burst onto the literary world with his first novel, \u201cThe Tenth Justice.\u201d His 11 novels have sold more than 10 million copies combined. \u201cI am Jim Henson\u201d is the 11th installment in the Ordinary People Change the World series, which has recently topped 1 million in sales. \u201cI am Gandhi\u201d and \u201cI am Sacagawea\u201d are due out in October.\nRIVER VALE: Artist tells kids they can be heroes\nHe\u2019s taken his love of history\u2019s mysteries to the small screen. He is the host of two History Channel shows: \u201cBrad Meltzer\u2019s Decoded\u201d and \u201cBrad Meltzer\u2019s Lost History.\u201d In fact, an episode of the later helped lead to the recovery of the missing Ground Zero flag from 9/11 immortalized in Thomas E. Franklin\u2019s iconic photo.\nAlong the way, he\u2019s made some friends in high places. While Meltzer was conducting research for \u201cThe Inner Circle,\u201d President George H.W. Bush gave him a copy of the secret letter that he had left in the Oval Office desk for his successor, President Bill Clinton. He was also invited to speak at first lady Barbara Bush\u2019s 90th birthday party.\nHe\u2019s just as comfortable, however, rifling through long boxes at the local comic book shop where he lives in Florida as he is hanging out in the Oval Office.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an overgrown child that truly does want to make a difference in this world,\u201d said River Vale illustrator Chris Eliopoulos, whose charming art work make Helen Keller, Lucille Ball and the others in the series accessible and even relatable to children. \u201cHe\u2019s the same with presidents as he is with little children, genuine through and through. The fact that he loves ice cream, comic books and Star Wars just helps him relate to the children better.\u201d\nBooks of relevance\nThe messages contained in the pages of the Ordinary People Change the World series apparently resonate with children and their parents today more than ever. Meltzer says sales of \u201cI am Rosa Parks\u201d and \u201cI am Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d were up 91 percent in November compared to the same time in 2015.\nNear as Meltzer can figure, that spike in sales was the residue of the bitter presidential campaigns waged by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cI think what the election proved is whatever side you voted for, you were terrified of the other team,\u201d Meltzer said. \u201cI think the parents of both Republican and Democratic side said, \u2018I don\u2019t like this other person. I\u2019m going to show you what a real hero is.\u2019 Both sides started purchasing the books like crazy.\u201d\nMeltzer thinks the parents arrived at the same place he was at when he started the series, when he set out to create a library of heroes to show his three children that fame is not the same as heroism, and a politician isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing as a leader.\n\u201cThe amazing thing is, these ideals, there\u2019s no politics about them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the only person you\u2019ll see on Fox News and NPR, OK? They go both ways. There are some things that, believe it or not, even today we all agree on. And I do believe, regardless of how votes go, that we all believe in wanting more kindness for others and wanting more acceptance for others and wanting this world to be a nicer place for other people.\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in the past year playing us versus them. To me, I\u2019m tired of us versus them. I want to get back to we and this is the only way I know to make it happen.\u201d\nIf you go\nWhat: Brad Meltzer and River Vale illustrator Chris Eliopoulos will be signing copies of their new children\u2019s book, \u201cI am Jim Henson.\u201d\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Jan. 10.\nWhere: Barnes & Noble, 97 Warren St., Manhattan.\nNote: Henson\u2019s daughter, Cheryl, will also be appearing.\nFor more information about the Ordinary People Change the World series, visit\u00a0 bradmeltzer.com\n61 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2idceWn\n"]]

Contact him at kellym@northjersey.com.\nIT\u2019S NOT too early to compare Chris Christie\u2019s Bridgegate scandal to Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate. And as all the governor\u2019s men (and women) seem to be lining up top criminal lawyers to protect them, a Watergate-related question is worth asking:\nWill there be a John Dean in this group?\nFirst some history. Just after midnight on June 17, 1972, police in Washington, D.C., arrested five men with electronic wiretapping equipment who had broken into the Democratic National Committee suite at the Watergate office complex. In short order, thanks to dogged reporting by The Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, police and the American public learned that the burglars were linked to the White House.\nThe story was tantalizing and certainly sparked for all manner of theories about why the White House would want to send a team of wiretappers into the headquarters of the Democratic Party. But, with Nixon and his top aides denying any connection to the burglary, the investigation seemed to stall.\nDirty tricks\nYes, the burglars were linked to such White House figures as E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy. And, yes, Nixon was no stranger to political dirty tricks. But despite months of finger-pointing by Democrats, no substantial evidence emerged that Nixon was directly involved in the burglary or cover-up.\nJohn Dean changed that. As White House counsel, he was essentially Nixon\u2019s lawyer \u2013 and, as we soon learned, much more. He not only knew about the plan by Nixon\u2019s political operatives to secretly gather information on Democrats by wiretaps, he took an active role in leading the coverup after the burglars were arrested. Dean even destroyed evidence.\nAdmitted guilt\nWhat is striking about him is that he admitted all this. A year after the burglars were caught, Dean walked into a hearing room on Capitol Hill and told the Senate Watergate Committee that the burglary and coverup were tied to a wide range of White House officials, including Nixon himself.\nDean\u2019s testimony was a turning point in the scandal\u2019s investigation. It would be followed by other major investigatory bombshells, including the revelation that Nixon tape-recorded phone calls and conversations in the Oval Office. Nixon\u2019s own words on those tapes eventually forced him from office.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that a four-day traffic jam in Fort Lee orches\ntrated as political retribution could become Christie\u2019s Watergate \u2013 and political Waterloo. But then Watergate started with what seemed to be an insignificant burglary. In politics, powerful people sometimes do really dumb, petty things.\nEven more ominous than Fort Lee\u2019s gridlock is the accusation that the Christie administration may have threatened to withhold funding to repair Hoboken after Hurricane Sandy if the city\u2019s mayor did not approve a development project whose lawyer is a close pal of the governor.\nHowever these investigations develop, they seem to need someone inside the Christie administration \u2013 what the governor calls his \u201ccircle of trust\u201d \u2014 to step forward and talk.\nTestimony for immunity\nDavid Wildstein, the political operative who some say orchestrated Fort Lee\u2019s traffic jams, promises to testify before a state legislative committee \u2013 but only if granted immunity.\nThis is a problem. Only federal prosecutors \u2013 and state prosecutors if they take the case \u2013 have power to grant immunity. As a source close to the legislative committee told me, \u201cWhy would prosecutors give immunity to a potential witness and then allow him to testify in public before the Legislature?\u201d\nWhat this signals is a potential conflict between the state legislative investigation of Bridgegate \u2013 now run by a joint Assembly-Senate committee \u2014 and the criminal probe by federal prosecutors and the FBI. Democrats in charge of the Legislature understandably want a public airing of the Bridgegate evidence \u2013 if only to embarrass Christie and cripple his presidential ambitions.\nBut why would any witness testify, knowing that federal prosecutors and FBI agents will be monitoring every word for potential evidence of a crime?\nThis was the question Wildstein faced when he was called to testify several weeks ago. He stated his name. But after that, he invoked his Fifth Amendment constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer any more questions \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t even confirm that he last worked at the Port Authority.\nState legislators have subpoenaed almost 20 others in Christie\u2019s circle to testify, but, according to a source, are worried all will follow Wildstein\u2019s lead and invoke the Fifth Amendment.\nSo where does the much-publicized, much-debated legislative investigation go? The joint committee will soon receive thousands of pages of emails and other documents it subpoenaed from a variety of figures linked to Bridgegate. But if the committee is going to dig deeper into this weird political story of a traffic snarl that may be linked to political retribution, it will need a narrator.\nRisky role\nThat was the role that John Dean took on \u2013 with some risk \u2013 in Watergate. After invoking the Fifth Amendment when called before a federal grand jury, Dean openly testified several months later before the Senate Watergate Committee and a national TV audience without any promise of immunity.\nEventually Dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and was given a prison sentence of one to four years. He served only four months after he agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors and testified in trials against other Watergate figures. But his felony conviction remained in place.\nWill David Wildstein agree to embark on this kind of path? What about others linked to Bridgegate, including former gubernatorial deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, Christie\u2019s campaign manager Bill Stepien and former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni?\nThis investigation needs a John Dean. Don\u2019t bet on anyone volunteering for that role anytime soon.\n"]]

Of course I was going to have a healthy year- I'm young, I'm in good shape, I don't have any serious vices, my diet is decent and I even make it to the gym every now and then. Thanks for the sentiment but I'm holding out for a ridiculously magical year, my health is just fine.\nNine years later, as a Chronic Pain patient, this polite gesture takes on a whole new meaning. I know it's said with with good intent but my well-wishers have no idea just how much work it takes to have a healthy day, let alone a whole year.\nPlanning is key\nThere are thousands of associations, support groups, alternative medical treatments and dietary recommendations that exist solely to help us learn to not just survive, but truly LIVE with this crazy condition.\nThere's so much help out there, it takes some effort to most efficiently take advantage of it all.\nFriends, I'd like to share how I reach my wellness goals and successfully manage my Chronic Pain throughout the year. (This system works for other goals too: career, budgeting, family, self care, etc.) I'll list the steps so you can join me.\nCopy this template. Grab a pencil, a pen, or a couple of markers to make it pretty, you'll be staring at this piece of paper for a year.\nThink big. Decide on and write down your overarching goals for the year. Pick two or pick ten, whatever feels right for you. My wellness goals for the year may be completely different than yours but feel free to use them for inspiration!\nFirst quarter (Q1) goals Ask yourself what you can do for the next three months to make progress towards your goal. Write them in your \"Q1\" box.\nFace it. Put your brave intentions somewhere you will see them often. Maybe a mirror or the fridge so it's staring you in the face every day.\nSo, here it is, my final version for the first quarter of the year. At the end of each quarter, I sit down with my list to assess. I go through each item and decide what worked and what didn't. If it worked, I add it to the next quarter, if it didn't work, I'll replace it with a new step that I think will work better. (This is also why I only plan one quarter out.)\nMy mantra for the New Year? \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.\"\nGood luck!\n*Join me in reading Agapi's book, Wake Up to the Joy of You .\n*Find my favorite in-home facial treatment mask here .\n\"Me vs. Fibromyalgia\" is a biweekly, one-of-a-kind series designed to give readers and warriors affected by Fibromyalgia a comprehensive look into the facts of the disease and the story of a driven, high-achieving business woman who wouldn't take no for an answer.

The group will be opening for the Gin Blossoms in Montclair on Feb. 25.\n(Photo: Photo by Pierfrancesco Baccaro, courtesy of Palestina.)\nThe Gin Blossoms will come to the Wellmont in Montclair on Feb.\u00a025. The\u00a0opening act will be local band, Thing One.\nThing One started as a punk hip-hop group back in 2003. Over the years their musical style has evolved to Indy pop rock, with elements of electronic.\nJoseph Palestina identified some of his main musical influences as Talking Heads, Beck and Steely Dan. Spen Miles said some of his influences were The Police, U2 and The Beatles.\nWhen asked why they\u2019ve been compared to the Beach Boys, Palestina said, \u201cWe try to go into the song writing process cognoscente of the music we grew up on. The Beach Boys component of our music is apparent because we really try to lay down some nice harmonies and bridges.\u201d\nWhile the band formed right out of college, making beats, their music has come a long way, without compromising their foundation. \u201cI thought I was a rapper,\u201d joked Palestina, \u201cWe were drawing from Gang Starr, The Roots\u2026 but then we started to fool around more with harmonies and blending the rock component.\u201d\nMiles added, \u201cI saw Ra Ra Riot playing in the city and they just blew the roof off. It opened my mind to making more Indy Rock. From there we started to write stuff more in that vein, and mixed with electronic.\u201d\nPalestina said the progression was natural for them. Miles and Palestina are childhood friends and that\u2019s when it really began. He said, \u201cWe would make movies together, we were always outside being a creative duo.\u201d\nThe Montclair Times wanted to know how Dr. Seuss became involved in their namesake. Palestina recalled, \u201cI remember walking into a college party with Spen on the phone and Spen said how about Thing One.\u201d Miles\u2019s version was less specific. He said, \u201cWe were trying to think of things reminiscent of our childhood. Something to be a throwback to that... the Thing One character from Dr. Seuss somehow came up and stuck.\u201d\nWhen asked how Thing One became involved in this show, Palestina said, \u201cDave the talent buyer for the Wellmont has been a Thing One fan since the early 2000s. We\u2019ve been going back and forth about acts we would want to open for. The timing was just right.\u201d\nThe Arizona born rock band Gin Blossoms started in 1987 and were well known for, among others, their hit song, \"Hey Jealousy.\" They lost their co-founder Doug Hopkins to suicide. The band subsequently broke up in 1997 and has been reunited since 2002.\nMiles said, \u201cThe Gin Blossoms were everywhere in the '90s. I remember loving their first album when it came out. We are super psyched to meet them and play with them.\u201d\nPalestina added, \u201cThey do a really good job at something Spen and I take pride in. Writing a really good pop-rock song!\u201d\n\u201cThe big guns are coming out for this one,\u201d said Miles, referring to all the band members getting together for this show.\nThing One is a band made up of local artists Tim Alworth (drums), Miles (co-founder, bass, guitar, composer), Palestina (co-founder lead singer, composer), Mike Rabasca (rhythm guitar) and Zach Abramson (keyboardist, bass player) all raised in Montclair and Glen Ridge. Adam Arcano (guitarist) was raised in Connecticut.\nTheir latest EP, \"Fair Weather Friends\" is available now on iTunes, Spotify and Soundcloud.\nPalestina said it has been really special for them to grow up as best friends and still be best friends making music together. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way and been through a lot as a band, and to have this opportunity in our hometown with new music on the horizon is awesome. We are very grateful.\u201d\nBuy tickets to the show: http://concerts.livenation.com.

Through this platform, Huffington and other celebrities like Jeff Bezos, Tina Fey, and Selena Gomez talk about the importance of rest and how it leads to increased success.\nIn a country with thousands upon thousands of entrepreneurs -- who are specifically prone to burnout by working long hours and getting little sleep -- Huffington's push for Z-catching is certainly good news.\nHowever, roughly 60 million Americans aren't electively awake at all hours of the night: they suffer from insomnia. To that end, biotech startups are raising capital for better solutions. For instance, Blake Insomnia Therapeutics is conducting a single-digit million dollar raise to help them innovate products that induce sleep in a more efficient way, addressing the fact that popular sleep aids like Lunesta and Ambien can still cause drowsiness during the day, which is not conducive to mental clarity or productivity.\nInsomnia itself costs the US government between $15 and $92 billion alone in healthcare costs and loses about $63.2 billion per year in employee productivity; even more devastating, statistics show that 100,000 vehicle accidents occur each year due to drowsy driving. As such, Blake Insomnia is working with a compound (branded as Zleepax), which uses a beta blocker as its primary ingredient, thereby reducing the side effects of drowsiness or restless sleep.\nBut for those who are looking to get a better sleep and improve their productivity the natural way, the number one remedy may be to disconnect from technology a few hours before bed, according to Huffington.\nWith the invention of the smartphone, we have a portal to everything we have to think about each day - our to do list, constant texts, work emails, mindless internet surfing , so it's no wonder that we can't turn off our brains.\nIn fact, research study by the University of Zurich found that those who constantly use their smartphones have an elevated level of brain activity every time they touch their fingers to their phone's screen, which leads to severe stress on the mind.\nIn the same vein, according to Addiction Tips , keeping one's phone next to the pillow is the worst thing you can do for your sleep; when you look at your phone, it confuses your melatonin levels and can lead to insomnia.\nFor a better night's sleep, experts suggest leaving your phone in another room and disconnecting from all technology a couple hours before bed, allowing your brain to wind down. Since many of us are addicted to our phones and are afraid to miss work messages, this will be difficult. But ultimately, better rest leads to increased productivity, which may just increase our career success -- and lead to a better quality of life.\nFollow Danielle Sabrina on Twitter: www.twitter.com/daniellescorp\nMore:\n"]]

Speaker. Advisor. Advocate of social entrepreneurship.\nToday more than ever, your own network is the key to successfully funding your business.\nYou may be reading that statement and think, \"Well, what do I do when my network isn't very big? I have friends and family but not those kinds of friends and family.\"\nA New York Times article revealed that the average American person has at least 600 people in their network. That's not a small number! If you are reading this article, I'd be willing to bet that YOU are not average which means that you've got at least 600 people you can reach out to. You've likely got a network that is a lot bigger than you think.\nEarlier this year I started working with two talented women entrepreneurs who run a fantastic adult sleep-away camp called Soul Camp . Upon the start of our collaboration, they were contacted by Google to investigate incubating their business. AMAZING!!!\nThe cost to be incubated by Google comes with a high ad spend requirement. These founders needed some extra capital to cover these costs but didn't think they had a strong enough network to help them find funding. I was convinced otherwise and immediately walked them through my Sx6 Finding Investors Formula and we developed a sound strategy that made sense. We tapped straight into their network and got them funded in under 60 days.\nStart The Discovery Process\nThe first thing you need to do is set aside some time and start writing down (or typing if you are a spreadsheet guru) a list of all your family members, all your friends, all the people you've worked with in the past, people you've done business with, clients, everyone you can possibly think of who knows you and likes you.\nStress creeping up at the thought of reaching out? Don't worry, the point is not to directly ask these folks to invest in your business. Instead, you are going to shift your mindset and enlist these people as your tribe of fundraisers. Think of this as an opportunity to reconnect and share the excitement of what you are up to. If you are embarrassed about your business and what you are building, then you may need to rethink it altogether.\nOtherwise, head up, shoulders back, smile on, engage that enthusiasm and make it your goal to have a phone conversation with everyone on your list. DO NOT DO THIS BY EMAIL! Email doesn't allow for two very important things:\n1. Enlisting your tribe means that you need to show them that you care first. A phone conversation allows for you to explore how you can help them with one specific thing. That thing could be as simple as an introduction, a link to an article, etc. This is a critical step in your fundraising process.\nYes, it requires effort on your part. Yes, you are running a business and don't have a lot of time. I GET IT! However, unless you have months or years to wait around to get funded, unless you have all the word-of-mouth advertising you could ever want, you must take the time to have these conversations with your network.\nDoing so will build an army of brand ambassadors who tell everyone they know about your business and connect you with others who are interested in funding you. Or maybe someone in your network, perhaps someone with young money, will seize the opportunity to immediately invest in you. Whatever the outcome, ALL of this comes at no cost other than a call and simple act of generosity. The return on investment of your time now is well worth it!\n2. During this phone conversation you are going to ask one very important question: \"Who do you know that might be interested in meeting with me to learn more about this opportunity?\"\nAfter asking, pause and wait for the response. Let them mention two or three people they know, and then make it really easy for them to help you. Tell them that you are going to provide the exact email they can copy, paste, and send to those people they mentioned. By crafting the email for them and sending it either during the conversation or within minutes after, you are increasing the likelihood of the connection happening--because you've made the task almost effortless.\nYou may not have phone numbers for every person on your list, so get resourceful and use things like LinkedIn to figure out how to get them on the phone. If you do this exhaustively, I promise you will be amazed at the results.\nPut Fear Aside\nFear gets in the way of you going big. It stunts curiosity. When you're afraid, you don't ask important questions that can get you from no funding to fully funded in a matter of weeks.\nMore importantly, fear keeps you from tapping into your connections who want to support and help you. As a result, you could be leaving your ideal investor in the dark, with no idea that you're out there looking for funds. Since you are only six degrees of separation from your ideal investor, think Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, or Marcus Lemonis, not tapping into your network means you could be missing out on connecting with someone really big. You'll never know...\nConversely, by bravely reaching out to your connections, you're empowering yourself to do big things in the world. Finding and securing the right funding sources will enable your business to have the kind of impact that positively affects the lives of everyone in your network and beyond--and perhaps help you become the richest woman in the world.\nIn honor of Woman's Equality Day, let's acknowledge the progress made since women were first granted the right to vote and also recognize that women are upgrading the leadership rules . Yet, despite these strides, the reality is that less than 5 percent of all venture capital investment goes to a woman-owned business or one with a woman on the executive team, as reported by the Diana Project. All the more reason for women in business to move beyond their fear and secure funding within their own network.\nBelieve In Possibilities\nMaking connections and growing your network isn't a stand-alone action for success. It's part of a larger process that starts with believing that anything is possible.\nConfidently tapping into your network is key! The authors of the Confidence Code say it well, \"Confidence is life's enabler. It is the quality that turns thoughts into action. Confidence does require a choice: less worrying about people-pleasing and perfection and more action, risk taking, and fast failure.\" Be your own hero and take action, which means being prepared. Here is a list of ten questions every savvy investor will ask . Boost your confidence by making sure you are prepared to answer each of them.\nFear cannot live in inspired action, so do what it takes to identify and tap into your connections, make sure you are prepared and you'll find yourself moving forward in a very big way.\nfbq('init', '439048219628085'); fbq('track', \"PageView\");}catch(e){}\nFollow Jennifer Love on Twitter: www.twitter.com/JLoveBiz\nMore:\n"]]

John \"Jay\" Rockefeller, D-W.Va.\nFull Coverage: Chris Christie and the GWB lane closure controversy\nNew documents released Thursday show that Fort Lee police and officials were not the only ones kept in the dark about the Sept. 9-12 lane closures that created huge backups leading to the George Washington Bridge.\nDavid Wildstein, now the former director of interstate capital projects, also kept information from going to Transcom, an organization composed of police departments and transportation agencies in the region that is charged with disseminating traffic conditions to improve \u201cthe mobility and safety of the traveling public.\u201d\n\u201cTranscom was not notified,\u201d the Port Authority said in response to an inquiry by U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller IV, chairman of the transportation committee. \u201cMr. Wildstein indicated at the time he issued his directive to change the toll plaza configuration that he would control the communication.\u201d\nHad Transcom \u2014 created by the Port Authority in 1986 with the mission of coordinating road projects to ease congestion \u2014 been kept in the loop, agencies such as the state police, the state Transportation Department and the New York Police Department would likely have been notified of the lane closures. Transcom now operates independently as a non-profit funded by its member agencies and the federal government.\nThe Sept. 11 anniversary is a high alert day for law enforcement agencies nationwide, but especially in the New York region. And the bridges and tunnels that traverse the Hudson River have always been considered potential targets. The report makes it clear that little, if anything, was done to ensure that emergency responders knew of the tie-ups leading to the bridge from Fort Lee.\nRockefeller, D-W.Va., said the documents, a two-page cover letter and 15 pages of responses to detailed questions Rockefeller sent in December, include \u201czero evidence\u201d of \u201ca legitimate traffic study.\u201d\nThey do show Wildstein ignored the authority\u2019s chief engineer, who warned that cutting from three to one the number of tollbooths accessible from local Fort Lee streets would increase \u201cthe risk of sideswipe crashes\u201d as rush-hour traffic merged into one lane.\nWildstein told authority staff he wanted to \u201cseek a new balance of traffic flows\u201d from bridge approaches on Routes 95, 80, 46 and 4 \u201cby providing more peak-period toll lane capacity.\u201d\nThe result was gridlock in Fort Lee for hours, and trouble for local police and rescue squads who couldn\u2019t get through town. Those trying to cross the Hudson found themselves sitting in traffic for hours. And calls to the Port Authority provided no relief. It wasn\u2019t until The Record\u2019s Road Warrior columnist John Cichowski inquired about the traffic jams that the agency\u2019s executive director, Patrick Foye \u2014 who was also kept in the dark by Wildstein \u2014 ordered the lanes reopened. But that was on Sept. 13, two days after the traditional Sept. 11 memorial service at the World Trade Center.\n\u201cThis obviously wasn\u2019t done in any way to assist the public,\u201d said Richard Slepian, a risk analyst and founder of the Forseeable Risk Analysis Center in New York. \u201cIt was done to hurt the public.\u201d\nSlepian said emergency vehicles in towns outside Fort Lee were probably affected as well.\n\u201cA siren doesn\u2019t do any good if a lane is closed. And it\u2019s not just that there\u2019s fewer lanes, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t know the lane is shut until you get stuck in the traffic,\u201d he said.\nLeonia Councilman Darryl Whitter said Leonia police typically would be notified of any disruption to traffic flow. Mayor John DeSimone said the borough and its police need to plan for it.\n\u201cIt creates a serious safety issue when Fort Lee Road backs up,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to get more police out there.\u201d\nHe said the borough would try to recoup costs from the Port Authority if there were any police overtime costs.\nCapt. Stephen Jones of the New Jersey State Police said neither the mayor, police chief nor any other Fort Lee official contacted his agency during those four days.\nNor were state police notified by the Port Authority of the lane closures, he said.\n\u201cWe get notifications sometimes when there\u2019s significant traffic incidents,\u201d he said.\nBut Transcom \u2014 which has Cedric Fulton, the Port Authority\u2019s director of tunnels, bridges and terminals, on its board \u2014 never got the chance to notify its members about the traffic disruptions, according to the documents.\n\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be the ones who make sure everybody who needs to know about something knows,\u201d said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University civil engineering professor and expert on traffic technology.\nStandard procedure at the Port Authority calls for notifying Transcom about traffic disruptions caused by unplanned events such as accidents and planned events such as maintenance or walkathons. At the bridge, it also calls for notifying Fort Lee.\nThat didn\u2019t happen, and in stark terms, the authority laid blame at Wildstein\u2019s feet.\nOn Sept. 6, a Friday, Wildstein told Robert Durando, the bridge\u2019s general manager, to close the lanes the following Monday at 6 a.m., the documents say.\n\u201cMr. Wildstein directed Mr. Durando not to communicate information about the lane reductions to officials in Fort Lee. Mr. Wildstein also made it clear that he would control the communication about the toll lane closures,\u201d the documents say.\nThat included within the authority itself. Fulton wanted assurances that Wildstein had briefed Foye, the executive director. Wildstein said that \u201cwas being handled.\u201d\nBut, \u201cMr. Wildstein failed to inform or brief the executive director,\u201d the documents say.\nRockefeller, the Senate committee chairman, asked for details about the closure because he believes interstate toll authorities, which are chartered by Congress, need someone watching over them.\nIn its cover letter, the authority struck a conciliatory tone, promising to cooperate with investigations \u201cto ensure that what occurred at the GWB never occurs at any of the Port Authority\u2019s facilities again,\u201d wrote Karen E. Eastman, the secretary to the board of commissioners.\nShe called the closures \u201caberrational events \u2026 which are not in any way representative of the manner in which business is conducted at the Port Authority.\u201d\nRockefeller said: \u201cI hope this is the case, but the Port Authority needs to fully explain what steps it is taking to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\nStaff writer Lihn Tat contributed to this report.\nEmail: jackson@northjersey.com Blog: northjersey.com/thepoliticalstate\n"]]

They're more common than you think.\nFear is a normal, biological response to everyday issues that spark anxiety , such as asking for a raise, confronting a loved one, and crossing the street to avoid a creepy stranger. This kind of stress can actually be useful, making you more alert and attentive until you feel safe and calm . Most of us learn early on how to function through fear and are not held back by it. But for some, certain fears can be more overwhelming and immobilizing than others.\nRelated: 4 Ways to Boost Your Mood Naturally\nHeights, flying, and snakes are just a few things that evoke intense emotions in some people. For those who experience a persistent, unreasonable, and excessive fear, they may have what experts consider to be a \"phobia,\" according to the definition found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition (DSM-5).  When one or more objects, places or situations trigger a reaction, it's called specific phobia-- the most common of three classifications under phobia , which also includes social phobia (fear of being judged or embarrassed)  and agoraphobia ( fear of open spaces ).\nIf you suffer from a phobia, you may change your life to accommodate your fear, says Anu Asnaani, Ph.D.,  an assistant professor at the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety Center at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. For example, someone with a specific phobia of dogs (or cynophobia) may skip their best friend's birthday party where the four-legged fur-balls will be present. Phobia, unlike normal anxiety, is irrational and extreme. Rather than ask the pet owners to keep their pooches on leashes, the person will simply opt to miss out on what otherwise could have been a fun social gathering celebrating someone they love.\nWhat causes a phobia? Both nature and nurture. \"If your parents have a predisposition to a fear of heights or a fear of flying that behavior can be learned,\" she says. A traumatic situation, like being bit by a dog as a kid, can also morph into a phobia, she adds. Other times, a genetic predisposition puts you at an increased risk ,  but mostly it's a combination of inheritance and the environment.\nRelated: Can Mindfulness Really Reduce Pain?\nIs fear holding you back? The DSM-5 estimates 7 to 9 percent (that's up to 22 million) of Americans suffer from phobias of some kind, such as the subtle yet powerful ones outlined below. The good news: Exposure therapy--a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which involves slowly exposing someone to their fear over time--is incredibly effective in treating all phobias, Asnaani says. \"Teach your body to sit in the presence of something that makes you scared without running away until your anxiety naturally comes down on its own,\" she says. Also, consider practicing a relaxation technique, like this meditation ,  to help regain your calm. Lastly, talk to your primary care physician or a mental health professional about other therapy options to help quiet your phobias and fears so you can live a bigger, bolder life .\n5 Phobias You May Not Realize Affect You\n1. Social Phobia: Also referred to as social anxiety disorder, social phobia affects about 10 percent of Americans, Asnaani says. What makes this group particularly uneasy: \"Being negatively evaluated by other people and being seen as deficient socially in some way,\" she says. You may worry that others think you're stupid, unattractive, or incompetent, she notes. While this level of discomfort rears its ugly head in all sorts of situations, it's most commonly seen in public speaking scenarios. People with social phobia may also avoid anything that has to do with other people, including asking questions or eating in front of others, or even using public restrooms.\nThe advent of technology has made it easier for socially phobic people to get by, Asnaani says. Today, you can work from home (limiting real interaction with people) and even avoid social settings, such as grocery stores thanks to online food shopping services. Texting also limits the need for real-life conversation. This presents an issue when trying to re-engage socially phobic people into the world. \"You lose important social interaction that we believe keeps us human,\" she says.\n"]]

(Partial Transcript Below)\n...\nGovernor Christie: Well, first off, there are lots of reasons for the firing and what I said the day afterwards was that I can't have somebody who works for me that lies to me, because that stuff can extend to a whole variety of subjects that are much broader than just the one that you talked about.\nAudience Member: Agreed.\nGovernor Christie: Do not take from my silence, on the act, that the act was countless, in fact the whole press conference was about the fact that what happened was absolutely unacceptable and that I didn't know anything about it and if I had, I wouldn't have permitted it. So my view was that, inherent in what I was saying, was that I disapproved of the act also. And I did, and do. But don't take from the fact that I said I fired her because she lied, that that means if she had told me the truth\u2014if she had told me the truth she would have gotten fired too because of what she did. But I never had the chance to hear the truth. And the offense -- the offense, first and foremost, is not being honest with the person you're working for.\nThe secondary offense was if she had been honest and told me, yeah she would have been fired anyway. But the fact is that when you're trying to run a government with 65,000 people that work for you\u2014I used to say this at town hall meetings all the time, and I really didn't know how prophetic I was being, I used to say that the most frightening thing about being the Governor of New Jersey is that you have 65,000 people with letterhead with your name on it, and you don't know what they're doing. I found that out in real time on January 8th. But the fact is that you have to be able to trust the people that work with you. And if you don't, they have to go. Regardless of -- if she had lied to me about something I approved of, she would have been fired. So that was the point I was trying to make.\nAnd I thought that the point of the entire discussion that day, for an hour and fifty minutes, was that I did not approve of what happened. I did think that what happened was wrong and abusive, and that it shouldn't have happened. Now I'm going to put aside the question of whether it's legal or illegal, because there are prosecutors looking at this and all the rest of it, and I've said all along as Governor, since I used to be a prosecutor, that I don't talk about that kind of stuff because I want the prosecutors to do their job and we're letting them do their job. But you shouldn't misunderstand, nor should anybody else, that by the fact that that's what I fronted as the cause for her firing that there weren't also sub-causes that I thought was part of the whole conversation I was having, that people who listen to it would understand.\nI don't approve of what happened, I didn't approve of what happened, and I'm doing everything I can right now to make sure that something like that never happens again. One of the steps you do is get rid of the offending folks who thought that was ok, and who thought that it was ok that when asked directly: do you know anything about this? Did you have anything to do with it? And they say no, well then, that's the end of the ball game.\nSo, thanks for giving me the opportunity to expand on it. I thought -- and this is part of the challenge of communication in normal circumstances, but in a crisis it's an even bigger challenge is -- little did I know that in an hour and fifty minutes of answering questions, I didn't say enough. But, let me be really clear, let me be really clear -- and I thought I was really clear that day -- that what happened in that circumstance is unacceptable, not approved by me, would never be approved by me, and the folks who were involved in that absolutely would have lost their jobs, whether they told the truth or lied about it. But I will tell you, as the guy in charge, that when you can't count on people to tell you the truth in an enterprise this size, you're sunk. And so that's I think why I made the emphasis on it that I did, but please don't take from it that I thought the underlying conduct was somehow ok because it was not.\n(applause)\n"]]

Johnson Author, Energy Alchemist, Facilitator of Embodied Knowing, Student of Life, Follower of Joy.\nHave you ever noticed how you are just cruising along and ticking off those things on your to-do-list - whether for your business or your personal affairs -- and you are feeling really good and in cruise mode - when suddenly, it's like a trap door opens up beneath your feet and you fall into the black abyss? Yet again! Almost as if you had made no progress at all. I know, right! It can be extremely frustrating and disheartening to say the least, even when you can say it happens less often. This is what happened to me recently. Let me explain!\nThere I was, toodling along in creative mode, feeling really excited and filled with a  wonderful sense of accomplishment. I had completed writing for two new projects - my new book 'Fearlessly Alone ' and a collaborative project. Phew! (Which is the reason I hadn't written any blogs in a while and I had wanted to stay totally focused on getting these done.) Now, I found myself suddenly with heaps of more time on my hands, as you do when you complete a big project and are working to a deadline. There was a lot of empty space - to enjoy and for new stuff to come in. And it did! Some really great and easy new stuff and some not so new stuff, obviously still hidden in the dark recesses of my subconscious and that needed to be looked at in a new way. And yes, ouch that hurt!\nWhat really intrigues me when it comes to Awareness, is that being 'aware' enables me to access pools of information all of the time. This is a relief to the perfectionist in me, because it means I don't have to learn everything - all I have do is tune in to my Awareness and allow that specific information to show up. Of course this attitude means I have to give up the need to control every single little aspect of everything. All of which is fueled by a fear of failure. Now, I am not going to lie and say that this always runs smoothly. Cause just like those little emoticons that pop up on your screen, when strong emotions are at play, it can make for a rocky day. So it helps me to have a strategy for firstly coping and then resolving. Sounds good, doesn't it! And so how can this hurt, you may be wondering?\nA while ago, I signed-up for breakthrough session with a coach whose work I have participated in and whose expertise I respect and admire. So I was looking forward to the 30 minutes conversation and hoping for some more clarity around a specific issue. You know, one of those areas in my life where I still felt like I 'had to work on myself'. It was not five minutes into the call and conversation, when my mood took a sharp nose-dive and it felt like I was floundering. By the end of the call, I hung up feeling  really down in the dumps and filled with doubt. What had happened?! Where had my sense of inner calm and accomplishment vanished to? Allow me to share.\nJust like many people, I have my 'down' moments and experience feelings of doubt, fear, anger at times - it is part of the human experience. Thank goodness though, that I have the strategy that I mentioned earlier above, because here Life had presented me with an opportunity to apply it - take it for another test run. In other words, a curve ball. I was faced with an opportunity to grow. I knew there was something positive and insightful to take away from this situation and that would reveal to me, my inner workings and how they were derailing me and looking for fine-tuning. Whereas previously, these kinds of moments would last for days, if not weeks or months and become situations, nowadays I am happy to say that whilst they hurt in the moment, they no longer lasted very long anymore. The highs and the lows are becoming more harmonious!\nNow, if you don't yet know me or my story, then I want to share that 'walking my talk' is an essential and practical part of how I choose to experience Being Me. It is also an important part of the 'know how' that I teach, about how to move away from overwhelm and stress and move into a place of being able to make choices calmly and confidently in daily life. Fortunately, I had recorded the conversation, so I could go back and listen.  I was curious as to what had triggered this downward emotional spike and so I listened to the replay. And I got real clear on the reason that it felt Ouch, That Hurt!\nWhat was evident to me when listening back over the conversation, was how, after the first few minutes, the way I spoke about myself and my situation came from a place of victim mentality and focus. It was a real eye opener for me, to listen to the way in which I spoke about my situation during this call and what I had focused on. Furthermore, I had doubted myself and where I was at on my timeline. I had allowed myself to become distracted! No wonder my feelings had plummeted! And thank goodness they had. My inner alert system is working well. I had to listen to the replay for a third time - this time with conscious detachment - before I felt my inner calm and energy once again. It no longer hurt!\nWhat did I take away from this experience?\nThis served as such a wonderful wake-up call for me and the realizations that there are still parts within myself that may feel afraid and full of doubts.\nBy choosing to love these parts of myself and to thank them for showing me that my journey of knowing myself unfolds more each day in remarkable ways, I was able to raise my vibration again to a place of feeling good.\nThis incident proved to be a powerful reminder to honour and follow my own Inner Authority, no matter what or who I was talking to.\nRespecting and admiring another person does not mean disregarding what I know does or does not work for me.\nI am the one who picks up the tab and so I figure that allows me to choose and enjoy the contrast of experiences that springs up and seems appropriate for me.\nIn the moment I was able to be grateful for and release the Ouch, that hurt and turn it into a Yay, I am on my way!\nEvery situation is an opportunity to take stock of where I am on my vibrational scale of inner balance, because what is within is reflected without.\nI am so grateful for this experience that brought me greater understanding of myself!\nCan you identify an area or situation  in your life where you felt down or heavy and then something wonderful emerged later on? Where you turned your Ouch that hurt, into a Yay! ? Choose to believe that not only does Life have your back - you do as well!

The topic was 'Getting comfortable with the uncomfortable' and was very apt given that at least 60 in the audience were on the second week of a Remote Year. What's that I hear you ask?\nRemote Year is a young company which has grown exponentially in it's short 2-year lifespan. Basically it works like this, you sign up to travel the world with a group of like minded 'digital nomads'. You spend each month in a different country. The group I met started in Spain and will travel their way east around the world to such places as Serbia, Cambodia, Argentina and so on. You pay a fixed fee upfront (to cover basics I imagine) and then a monthly fee for every month you travel. In return, all of your travel, accommodation and co-working spaces (in every location) are organized for you. You even get given a SIM card!\nI'm a keen traveler, I've made it my personal ambition to travel to every single country in the world or die trying so it was apt that I had a chance to speak to them on the other side of their fresh and brave step into the unknown. It's common for us to wobble even after we've taken action, but by then at least you know you've made the most difficult part happen - the first step. It's no mean feat to conquer your own inner fear.\nWe are pre-programmed to actively avoid discomfort, to pay attention to our insecurities and to heed fear. Why? Because it keeps us alive. This is the negativity bias in action. Mankind has lasted for generation after generation by focusing on the potential threats, risks and 'what ifs' and acting accordingly. It's a fundamental survival technique ingrained in us. BUT it does not account for, neither adjust for, the fact that we no longer have predators and it is uncommon to be in situations where our lives are under threat.\nWhat's more likely these days is that our survival response and fear centre (amygdalae) kicks in when we dare to think about quitting our job. When we consider moving to a new country, changing careers, leaving an unhappy circumstance. We are naturally resistant to change because change means uncertainty and uncertainty (in the past) increased our chances of premature death.\nSo what can we do about it?\nWell first of all we need to acknowledge what we're feeling, recognize that it's a primal response and that it doesn't mean we actually are under threat. Ultimately, we need to get used to the feeling of fear and uncertainty. We need to bathe in the uncomfortable.\nI once attended a conference where Dan Sullivan recounted a story from his days in the Vietnam war. His troop had to do some grenade training. They were shown the night before and expected to practice with live grenades the following morning. You can imagine how well they slept that night!\nThe next morning the platoon leader asked for those who weren't afraid to raise their hand, everyone except Dan put their hands up. He then declared that Dan was the only one he trusted as they all SHOULD be afraid. For being honest his reward was that he had to go first- yikes! He stepped forward, shaking (let's remember these are LIVE grenades) and threw the grenade. Everything went as it should. The Sargent major asked how he felt before throwing the grenade, Sullivan said 'like pissing my pants' and the Sargent major declared that was the difference between those who feel fear and the brave. The brave do what they have to do WITH wet pants.\nThat's exactly the point I want to make.\nBravery is NOT the ABSENCE of fear. The brave feel the fear, the uncertainty, the doubt, but move forward in spite of it. They do not let it be a reason to not move forward.\nYou see if we all waited until the 'right time' until we felt comfortable, confident, 100% capable, we would be in our rocking chairs before we did anything. Indeed, millions of misinformed people have been sold the wrong dream. Many in the first world (particularly North America) believe the holy grail in life is 'security', a life long job and the accumulation of 'things' instead of the collection of experiences. This has largely been handed down from the generation before them born into a post-war world (when such aspirations made sense). Indeed you may wonder what's to question. I reject this capitalist dream that keeps you 'safe' and in one spot because it sells us 'comfort' as the end goal.\nBut nothing amazing EVER happens in your comfort zone!! You do not grow, learn, stretch, develop or have earth shattering a-ha moments in your comfort zone!\nThe most rewarding and amazing experiences, journeys and learning you will gather sit at the other side of fear and uncertainty. Possibilities, opportunities, lifestyles that you can barely conjure up in your imagination are OUTSIDE your comfort zone. When you stay in the safety of 'comfort' you are playing a small game in life. Palliative nurses site the number 1 regrets of the dying to be - I wish I had the courage to live the life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. Maybe we should listen to the wisdom from the grave.\nI want you to use your imagination now, I want you to picture the scene....you are standing on the edge of a cliff, the plan is to jump into the blue ocean below, part of you is exhilarated by the anticipation of it all, but you have uncertainty, you know it will be an adrenaline rush, but you don't know what it's going to be like until you do it. You have doubts, you're torn, much as in life. So you pace, you walk along the side of the edge looking down. You retrace your steps again looking down at the fate below. You walk up to the edge and quickly walk back. You think yes, then you think no.\nThe cliff is an analogy for the big decisions in your life (and for some maybe ALL decisions in life). There are people who well spend the majority, if not all of their life on the edge of that cliff thinking 'what if..?' Then there are the brave and the bold who, whilst still having the same doubts as the others, at some point they muster the courage and JUMP. That moment, the point of jumping, is as uncertain for the jumper as it is for those who don't jump. The difference is that they feel the uncertainty and jump in spite of it.\nSo here's the question. In your life, where are you going to be? Are you going to be on the edge of your life (quietly reassuring yourself that it's ok here and that those jumpers are crazy anyway) or are you going to be the one that jumps straight into life, in spite of its uncertainty? To be on the edge of your life? Or to get comfortable feeling uncomfortable and jump into your life anyway?\nWhich is it to be?\nFollow Jodie Rogers on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Jodie__Rogers\nMore:\n"]]

Contact him at kellym@northjersey.com.\nCHRIS CHRISTIE wants you to think of him as a hands-on kind of leader. To put it another way, he pays attention. Storm-damaged boardwalks down the Shore, tax debates in Trenton, the Super Bowl, police pensions, teacher tenure \u2013 he\u2019s involved.\nBut then there is the matter of those traffic jams last September in Fort Lee.\nWhat resonates from almost every page of the 344-page tax-funded, million-dollar report about the lane closure scandal and other issues is how out-of-touch Christie was.\nAt least, that\u2019s the way he was depicted.\nReading the report, which continues to be intensely analyzed and debated, it almost seems as if Christie had loaded his iPod with the soundtrack of the Diana Ross-Michael Jackson film, \u201cThe Wiz\u201d and routinely sang, \u201cDon\u2019t No Body Bring Me No Bad News\u201d as he strolled the hallways of the State House.\nThe man seemed clueless, out of the loop, uninvolved and uninformed.\nBy the way, did I mention that the report completely exonerates Christie?\nThe man who knew nothing \u2013 and perhaps wanted to know nothing \u2013 did nothing wrong. How convenient.\nDevil in the details\nBut as in so many matters in life, the devil is in the details. And in this case, the report, which is quickly becoming an embarrassment to the Christie camp, offers up a series of events that should raise questions why the most powerful man in the state was never told about a potential problem at the world\u2019s busiest bridge.\nLet\u2019s return to those grid-locked days last September.\nAfter drivers complained about traffic jams lasting hours on Fort Lee\u2019s narrow streets leading to the George Washington Bridge, my colleague, John Cichowski, who writes The Record\u2019s \u201cRoad Warrior\u201d column, sent an email to a Port Authority media flak. What\u2019s going on at the bridge? he asked.\nThe email did not suggest that a major political scandal was brewing. Certainly, it did not hint that Christie\u2019s staff might be involved. Cichowski, who has developed a terrific rapport with reader-drivers, merely wanted to learn why there were such monumental traffic snarls in Fort Lee.\nSeems simple and unthreatening,\u00a0right?\nWell, now we learn from the report that Cichowski\u2019s email was circulated to Christie\u2019s top appointees at the Port Authority, Bill Baroni and David Wildstein. Then, it was sent to Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and to the governor\u2019s press secretary, Michael Drewniak.\nThe report, which cites all manner of internal Port Authority communication, depicts the matter as merely a Port Authority traffic study of lane changes. If so, why was Christie\u2019s press secretary drawn into the loop?\nDrewniak is no rookie. He\u2019s an experienced political operative. Didn\u2019t he find any of this strange? And if so, why not at least mention something to Christie?\nThe report does not answer those questions.\nIt\u2019s understandable why Wildstein and Kelly did not tell Christie about the Fort Lee traffic jams. Wildstein and Kelly appeared to be prime instigators of the scheme to create havoc in Fort Lee. As for Baroni, he seemed also aware that something wrong was afoot.\nBut Drewniak? Why didn\u2019t he see a problem?\u00a0\nFoye enters the drama\nThe next day, Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye got involved. He not only stopped the lane-realignment scheme but he raised an issue that surely should have gotten Christie\u2019s attention. Foye said the lane closures that paralyzed Fort Lee were not only \u201chasty and ill-advised,\u201d but that the plan \u201cviolates federal laws and the laws of both states.\u201d\nBaroni forwarded Foye\u2019s email to Wildstein and to Regina Egea, who runs the Authorities Unit in Christie\u2019s office. Egea then sent the email to the unit\u2019s lawyer, Nicole Crifo.\nNo one told Christie that laws may have been broken in the state he runs \u2013 or so the report says.\nThe story does not end there, however. Over the next two weeks, the accusation was raised in the media that the lane closures were political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for failing to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection. Foye\u2019s email suggesting that laws had been broken also was publicized.\nAgain, Christie\u2019s staff discussed this, including the governor\u2019s deputy chief of staff for communications and planning, Maria Comella, and his deputy communications director, Colin Reed.\nNo one thought to tell Christie.\nThe report does not explain why. It suggests only that the lane closure controversy was not considered all that important \u2013 and, therefore, not worthy of bringing up with the governor. If that\u2019s the case, why were so many key gubernatorial staffers \u2013 members of what Christie would later call his \u201ccircle of trust\u201d \u2013 drawn into discussions?\nCommon sense\nWhat\u2019s missing here is common sense. Christie is not a monk who takes a vow of silence and sits in his office all day. Staffers say he enjoys chatting with them and routinely asking about news, policy matters or politics. He also has developed a widespread network of friends and contacts.\nAnd no one thought to say, \u201cHey, Chris, something weird took place at the George Washington Bridge.\u201d? Christie\u2019s staff was hyper-alert last fall. They were, after all, in the midst of Christie\u2019s reelection campaign \u2014 a campaign in which Christie wanted to send a message to America\u2019s Republicans about his alleged electoral prowess.\nBut no one thought to tell Christie about the bridge problem. Such is the conclusion the report wants everyone to believe.\nImagine that.\n"]]

These women are in college or getting ready to apply to college, and come from backgrounds that make it a little harder to succeed in college. I spoke to them about the power of being fearless and mastering your own emotions when times get tough, or when you feel anxious, frustrated or afraid.\nFeeling afraid from time to time is entirely human. We are prewired to experience the rush of adrenaline and cortisol that prepares us to defend ourselves or run when we are threatened. It's a survival mechanism that tells your brain to pay attention and your muscles to prepare for danger, and it has been critical to the survival of the human species. However, we are not often faced with life or death situations in our daily lives. Our neural response to rejection from a selective club, or a harsh look from a teacher or boss, or a critical remark from a colleague is the same response we have when faced with a mortal threat. Our environment and circumstances are very different from primitive humans, but our biology is virtually unchanged.\nFortunately, as modern humans we have the knowledge and power to change our responses and thinking about what is happening to us, and shift fear to excitement. When you choose to ride a rollercoaster, you may encounter fear, excitement, or both. The chemical release in our bodies is the same. So what changes fear and anxiety into excitement and anticipation? The chemicals themselves only have meaning when we notice the sensation and then give it a name. And then we might associate that feeling with previous experiences-both good and bad. It is this pattern of thought after the initial rush of adrenaline that creates fear, or excitement. This is the point at which you can begin to change your emotional experience of the situation and what you do next.\nNow is the time of new beginnings for many new graduates, and we often have fear associated with embarking on new ventures, be they new studies, new jobs, a new relationship, or even a new project or responsibility. Fear of the unknown-\"Will I be successful?\" \"What if I fail?\" \"What will people think if I don't succeed?\" \"How will I manage this?\"-reveals a very human desire for control, and our obsession with avoiding loss or failure. Even when our track record indicates we will very likely succeed in our new endeavor, we tend to focus on the dire consequences of a failure.\nHow can we interrupt this cycle and focus on the positive outcomes we wish to create? Even better, how can we shift fear to excitement? The first key to shifting our emotions is to recognize when they appear and to notice the thoughts we are having about the situation. Promoted into a new job? You might think: \"What if I'm not qualified?\" \"What if no one respects me?\" \"What if I make a mistake?\" These kinds of questions are based on your own underlying fears (I'm not qualified, no one will respect me, and I will make mistakes). What more positive thoughts could you have in the same situation? How about, \"I have some great ideas about this new role,\" \"I am going to create a great team,\" and \"I will learn and improve as I do this new job?\" You need to choose new thoughts that feel equally true to you, and you can dramatically shift your anxiety to anticipation and excitement.\nFear is a normal part of life. What you do with that fear and how well you shift fear to excitement determines how well you are able to see the opportunity in every moment. To act fearless, you need to acknowledge and confront your fear, change the story you are telling yourself about what that fear really means, and choose a path that is focused on opportunity and positive outcomes. After all, what you focus on grows! Focus on the outcome you most want to create, rather than the poor outcome you are trying to avoid.\nFollow Laura Huckabee-Jennings on Twitter: www.twitter.com/leadfearlessly\nMore:\n"]]

Wisniewski and Sen. Loretta Weinberg speak following the joint committee's first meeting earlier this year.\nBy JOHN REITMEYER\nSTATE HOUSE BUREAU\u00a0|\u00a0\nThe Record\nThe co-chairs of the legislative committee investigating the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge say they want to see transcripts of the interviews conducted by the lawyers Governor Christie hired to compile the report that cleared him of any role in the lane closures.\nThe panel could soon move to subpoena the interview transcripts and seek additional oral testimony as well, said Senate Majority Loretta Weinberg, D-Teaneck, and Assemblyman John Wisniewki, D-Middlesex, on Monday.\n\u201cWhat I would want to see are all the interviews,\u201d Wisniewski said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have them we\u2019ll subpoena them.\u201d\nA report issued last week by lawyers from the firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher said more than 70 witnesses were interviewed, including Christie himself, to help determine why two of the three lanes used by the motorists who come onto the bridge in Fort Lee were closed down for several days last September.\nThe report found Christie played no role in the lane closures, instead casting blame largely on former Christie Port Authority appointee David Wildstein and the governor\u2019s former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly. The lawyers said the lane closures appeared to have been carried out to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, though it did not conclusively confirm suspicions that it was for his failure to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection bid last year.\nChristie on Friday held his first news conference since January, telling reporters the report was objective and based on wide access to his office and other government officials. He also sat for two national television interviews last week, discussing the report\u2019s findings and maintaining that he is still a viable contender for president in 2016.\nThe legislative committee led by Weinberg and Wisniewski sent subpoenas to the governor\u2019s office and several other individuals and organizations earlier this year seeking documents related to the lane closures.\nThe panel just recently received thousands of documents from the Christie administration. But both lawmakers said they don\u2019t think transcripts from the interviews the lawyers conducted for their lane closure probe have been turned over to the committee.\n\u201cThe next step will be to update our committee and with the guidance of counsel to figure out how best to get the documents upon which Mr. Mastro based his \u2018exhaustive inquiry,\u201d Weinberg said Monday.\nThe explosive e-mails and text messages, obtained and first reported by The Record, sparked a political firestorm that extended far beyond New Jersey and Fort Lee. For full coverage, click here .\nShe also said the team of lawyers led by Randy Mastro has not provided a list of the 70 witnesses it spoke to.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know who he interviewed,\u201d Weinberg said.\nThe committee has been waiting for the last few weeks on a ruling from a Superior Court judge in Mercer County on whether Kelly and former Christie campaign manager Bill Stepien have to obey the subpoenas they received from the committee for documents related to the lane closures. The attorneys for Kelly and Stepien have argued turning over documents would violate their constitutional rights.\nIn addition to seeking the interview transcripts used to compile the report released on Thursday, both Weinberg and Wisniewski said the committee is also considering calling news witnesses in for testimony.\n\u201cThere may be individuals that we choose to have come in for oral testimony,\u201d Wisniewski said.\nBoth lawmakers declined to identify who they are interested in speaking to.\nEmail: reitmeyer@northjersey.com\n"]]
